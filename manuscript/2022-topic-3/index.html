                Malaysia’s National Digital Identity Initiative (NDII) aims to
                revolutionise digital services and improve citizen engagement.
                This study investigates the awareness, perception and acceptance
                of National Digital Identity (NDI) among the Malaysian
                population. A quantitative research approach was used, employing
                cross-tabulation analysis, descriptive analysis and Rasch
                measurement analysis. The results show that targeted education
                campaigns are needed to ensure widespread understanding and
                acceptance of NDI. Demographic factors such as gender, age,
                marital status, ethnicity/race, education level and place of
                residence were associated with awareness of NDI. Privacy and
                security concerns emerged as significant barriers to uptake,
                highlighting the importance of robust security measures and
                transparent data processing practices. User-friendly design and
                the inclusion of biometric authentication methods were
                identified as key factors influencing adoption. Based on these
                findings, recommendations are made to promote awareness and
                acceptance of NDI. These include education and awareness
                campaigns, inclusive design, integration with existing services
                and targeted outreach based on demographic factors. It also
                identifies future research areas such as policy and regulatory
                frameworks, user-centred design, stakeholder engagement,
                implementation strategies and technological considerations to
                support the successful implementation of the NDII. This study
                provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers and
                stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of
                digital identity systems.<br />

                Malaysia is preparing to launch the NDII, which aims to create a
                secure and reliable digital identity system for its citizens.
                The success of the NDII depends not only on a strong
                technological infrastructure but also on public awareness,
                perception and acceptance. This preliminary study aims to
                provide insights into the expected public opinion towards the
                NDII in order to support its effective planning and
                implementation.<br /><br />In today’s digital age, digital
                identity systems are becoming increasingly important as they
                provide individuals with secure access to online services and
                improve administrative efficiency (Hilowle et al., 2022;
                Zulkifli et al., 2023). The NDII is expected to revolutionise
                service delivery, streamline processes and foster a more
                connected and digitally literate nation. However, before
                embarking on such a transformative project, a comprehensive
                understanding of public awareness, perception and acceptance is
                essential.<br /><br />This study recognises that the NDII has
                not yet been implemented and emphasises the need for
                forward-looking research to assess public expectations,
                concerns, and preferences. By collecting preliminary data, the
                study aims to inform policymakers, government agencies, and
                stakeholders about potential challenges and opportunities
                associated with the NDII so that they can develop tailored
                strategies.<br /><br />Using a survey-based approach, a diverse
                group of Malaysian citizens will be interviewed to measure their
                awareness of digital identity concepts, their perceptions of
                privacy and security, and their likely acceptance and adoption
                of the NDII. Conducting this pre-implementation survey will
                provide valuable insights that can support the development of
                targeted awareness campaigns, the removal of potential barriers
                and the improvement of user experience and satisfaction.<br /><br />This
                paper presents the rationale and methodology for the pre-study,
                emphasising the importance of understanding public opinion
                before implementing the NDII. The following sections focus on
                the literature review, methodology, research findings, and
                discussions that provide insight into public awareness,
                perception, and acceptance of the NDII. The article concludes
                with recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders,
                highlighting the need for ongoing research and evaluation as the
                NDII moves forward.<br /><br />Our aim with this preliminary
                study is to contribute to the successful implementation of the
                NDII in Malaysia by ensuring that public sentiments are taken
                into account, concerns are addressed and effective strategies
                are developed to maximise awareness, perception and acceptance
                among the Malaysian population.<br />

                Available studies on Malaysia’s NDII and related issues offer
                insights into public perspectives and privacy concerns. This
                section provides an overview of the research conducted in
                Malaysia that addresses the NDI framework, public attitudes
                towards digital applications, privacy concerns and data
                security.
                <br /><br />
                A 2020 public consultation report by PricewaterhouseCoopers was
                the only study on the NDI framework in Malaysia
                (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2020). It aimed to introduce the NDI
                concept, and gather feedback and recommendations. However, the
                study primarily focused on raising awareness among public and
                private sector employees through a limited survey.
                <br /><br />
                Turner and Sofia Amirnuddin (2018) explored Malaysians’
                perspectives on social media responsibility, privacy and
                personal data security. Participants felt that multiple parties,
                not just the government, should protect online privacy. They
                also emphasised the responsibility of social media users to
                protect their own data.
                <br /><br />
                Chua et al. (2021) examined how Malaysians’ willingness to share
                personal information varies according to demographic factors.
                The study found significant differences in privacy concerns and
                intentions to disclose different types of personal data. Age,
                gender and industry of employment influenced willingness to
                share information on tracking, finance, authentication and
                health.
                <br /><br />
                Nor and Fuat (2021) focused on understanding how Malaysian
                teenagers and young adults present themselves on Facebook. The
                study showed how individuals present themselves online and how
                they portray themselves. It emphasised the importance of
                educating adolescents, especially girls, about the consequences
                of their online persona and guiding them towards appropriate
                online behaviour.
                <br /><br />
                Shalihah and Mohd Shariff (2022) explored privacy and data
                protection challenges in equity crowdfunding activities in
                Indonesia and Malaysia. The research aimed to improve existing
                laws and regulations. While Malaysia has regulations such as the
                Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) of 2010, theft of personal
                data is more prevalent in Malaysia compared to Indonesia. The
                study highlights the need for ECF platform organisers to
                understand the provisions of the PDPA 2010.
                <br /><br />These studies provide insights into the public’s
                perspective, privacy concerns, and data protection challenges
                relevant to NDII in Malaysia. Policymakers and stakeholders can
                use these insights to promote public awareness, protect privacy,
                and ensure the successful implementation of the NDI
                framework.<br />

                The NDIIs have gained prominence around the world as governments
                seek to provide secure and convenient digital services to their
                citizens. This literature review examines the implementation and
                impact of NDIIs in Singapore, Canada, Morocco and the United
                Kingdom. By examining these international examples, valuable
                lessons can be learned for developing and improving similar
                initiatives in other countries.<br /><br />The Singapore
                government introduced Singpass, a robust personal authentication
                system for online government services, in 2003 (Bank, 2022).
                Singpass offers multiple login methods, including fingerprint,
                facial recognition and passcode, and provides secure and
                flexible access to digital services (Singapore, 2023). Singpass
                Mobile, the country’s mobile digital identity platform, has
                gained significant penetration, with over 2.1 million daily
                users. In addition, SafeEntry, an extension of Singpass used for
                COVID-19 check-ins, has further enhanced the platform’s
                usability and reach.<br /><br />In Canada, the Government of
                Canada’s Digital Ambition sets the strategic vision for digital
                service delivery, cybersecurity, talent recruitment and privacy
                (Boysen, 2021). A survey conducted by VMware found that the use
                of online government services in Canada continues to grow
                (Canada, 2022). 88 per cent of Canadians have already used such
                services. However, the survey also showed that public
                perceptions of government digital services lag behind those of
                the private sector and trust in government’s handling of
                personal data remains moderate.<br /><br />Morocco’s Digital
                Development Agency (ADD) and the Directorate of National
                Security (DGSN) have launched a national digital ID platform
                based on IDEMIA’s eID card technology (The Kingdom of Morocco
                Introduces a National Digital ID Programme, 2022). This
                initiative aims to improve digital trust, security and
                convenience for Moroccan citizens. The uptake of the new eID is
                remarkable: since August 2020, more than 10 million electronic
                identity cards have been issued, representing approximately
                one-third of the country’s population.<br /><br />The Verify
                system was launched in the United Kingdom in 2016 as a digital
                identity platform (DI) that allows citizens to access government
                services online (Harbinja, 2017). The system worked by verifying
                users’ personal data with the help of a third-party identity
                provider. Although it successfully expanded access to digital
                services and reduced fraud, it was criticised for its complexity
                and ease of use (Forum, 2023). Concerns were also raised about
                the system’s implementation costs and lack of support for
                smaller businesses. As a result, it was announced that the
                Verify system would be discontinued on 28 October 2022. From
                mid-December 2022, no new accounts were accepted and all Verify
                services were completely discontinued in April 2023.<br />

                This study uses a quantitative research design to measure the
                extent of public awareness, perception and acceptance of the
                Malaysian NDII before its official launch. This section provides
                an overview of the theoretical framework used in the study,
                outlines the process of developing the research instrument,
                explains the sampling methodology and describes the data
                collection and analysis procedures. As the NDII has not yet been
                adopted in Malaysia, the results of the study will be important
                in assessing the public’s readiness and identifying factors that

                The methodology used in this study is based on two (2)
                established theories: the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and
                the Perception of Risks and Negative Consequences Theory. TAM
                focuses on users’ attitudes and perceptions towards technology
                acceptance (Alshari &amp; Lokhande, 2022), while the Perception
                of Risks and Negative Consequences Theory examines the influence
                of perceived risks on the intention to adopt and use technology
                (Koester et al., 2022). By integrating these theories, this
                study aims to understand the factors that influence the
                acceptance and adoption of NDI services by Malaysians and
                contribute to the success of NDII in Malaysia.

                This section presents the comprehensive results and analysis
                obtained from a combination of descriptive analysis, Rasch
                measurement and cross-tabulation techniques. The aim was to
                explore the relationship between respondents’ information and
                their awareness, perception and acceptance of NDI services.<br /><br />The
                analysis began with descriptive statistics that provided an
                overview of respondents’ characteristics and their level of
                familiarity with different identity systems. This initial
                exploration allowed us to identify trends and patterns in
                demographic factors such as gender, age, ethnicity/race, work
                status, employment sector, education level, income level and
                country of residence.<br /><br />A Rasch measurement analysis
                was then conducted to gain a deeper understanding of
                respondents’ attitudes, concerns and expectations regarding NDI
                services. The Rasch analysis provided us with insights into how
                the survey questions functioned differently and allowed us to
                assess the relative difficulty and distinctiveness of each item.
                This analysis helped us refine the measurement scales and ensure
                the validity and reliability of the data.<br /><br />Building on
                the descriptive and Rasch measurement analyses, cross-tabulation
                techniques were used to examine the relationships between
                respondents’ statements and various aspects of NDI services.
                These analyses explored the relationships between demographic
                factors and awareness, perceived risks, expected benefits and
                preferences for NDI services.<br /><br />By combining results
                from descriptive, Rasch measure and cross-tabulation analyses,
                we obtained a comprehensive understanding of how different
                demographic and socio-economic factors influence awareness,
                perception and acceptance of NDI services. This integrated
                approach allowed for a nuanced examination of the data,
                revealing variations and trends that can inform targeted
                strategies and interventions.<br />

                monthly income of less than RM4,850 (80.4 per cent). The most
                represented states of residence were Pahang (11.6 per cent),
                Sarawak (10.6 per cent) and Sabah (10.1 per cent), while Pulau
                Pinang (1.3 per cent), WP Kuala Lumpur (2.6 per cent), WP Labuan
                (2.2 per cent) and WP Putrajaya (2.2 per cent) were the least
                represented. These demographic findings provide valuable
                information for understanding the differences in awareness,
                perceptions and uptake of the NDII among the different groups
                and allow for targeted strategies to increase uptake among the
                different demographic groups and maximise the success of the NDI
                system.<br /><br />The descriptive analysis results provide
                valuable insights into respondents’ awareness, concerns,
                expectations, and preferences regarding the NDII. The results
                show that a high percentage of respondents are familiar with
                various identity systems, such as password/ PIN, RFID,
                biometrics, IP address, and electronic signatures. This
                indicates that respondents have a good level of knowledge about
                these systems, which is an important factor for the successful
                implementation of the NDII.<br /><br />When assessing the risks
                associated with identification systems, it was found that the
                majority of respondents expressed concerns about potential risks
                such as online behaviour tracking, information being used
                against them, fraudulent charges on their credit cards, identity
                theft, disclosure of private information and unauthorised access
                to personal data. A smaller percentage of respondents were
                concerned about the risk of data compromise by hackers. These
                findings highlight the need to address these concerns in order
                to increase awareness, acceptance and perceived usefulness of
                identification systems.<br /><br />In terms of the benefits
                expected from a service such as NDII, most respondents indicated
                that they expected minimal user effort, ease of task completion,
                secure identification, cost savings, control over personal data
                and the ability to detect identity fraud. These expectations are
                consistent with the potential benefits of an efficient and
                secure digital identity system. These findings can be used in
                developing effective promotional strategies for the NDII to
                highlight the benefits to potential users.<br /><br />The
                analysis also explored the factors that might motivate
                respondents to use identification systems. The availability of a
                single data set containing all their transactions, interactions,
                and traces to increase their awareness of their surroundings was
                found to be the most motivating factor. Other motivating factors
                included data verification, details about the identification
                system, compliance with data protection regulations, a verified
                security credential, and safeguards against disclosure of
                information to third parties. These factors can guide the
                development of the NDII to meet user expectations and increase
                adoption.<br /><br />In terms of awareness of the NDI, the
                results showed that while a significant proportion of
                respondents were aware of the initiative, a significant number
                were not aware of it. This suggests that efforts to increase
                awareness and promote the NDII are necessary to achieve the
                intended impact. The results also indicate that the majority of
                the respondents would use the NDII for various services such as
                e-health records, government aid authentication, online
                government services, financial institution verification,
                telecommunication service verification, e-hailing verification,
                education-related authentication, e-commerce verification and
                pension authentication. This shows the potential impact of the
                NDII on several sectors.<br /><br />In terms of promotional
                methods, social media advertising, particularly on platforms
                such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter and TikTok, was
                cited as the preferred method of informing people about NDI
                services. Traditional media such as radio and television
                advertisements were also cited as effective advertising
                channels. These findings suggest that a combination of social
                media and traditional media approaches would be beneficial in
                promoting the NDII and increasing awareness and uptake among the
                target group.<br />

                The Rasch model provides a robust framework for measuring latent
                characteristics and analysing item responses. The results
                provide a comprehensive understanding of the participants’
                characteristics and the psychometric properties of the
                measurement instrument.<br /><br />The mean total score of
                participants was 44.5, indicating moderate levels of awareness,
                perception and acceptance of NDI services. The standard error of
                the mean was 0.3, indicating the accuracy of the estimated mean.
                The standard deviation of the person (P. SD) and the standard
                deviation (S. SD) were both 10.7, reflecting the dispersion of
                participants’ responses around the mean. The maximum score of
                54.0 and the minimum score of 0.0 show the full range of
                responses observed in the data.<br /><br />The Rasch analysis
                provides several indicators of the quality of the measurement.
                The real root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.81, which
                represents the average amount of residual variance between the
                model’s predictions and the observed data. A lower RMSE
                indicates a better fit of the model to the data. The true
                standard deviation, distance and person reliability provide
                information about the reliability and precision of the
                measurement. In this study, the true standard deviation was
                1.05, the distance was 1.30 and the person reliability was 0.63,
                indicating acceptable measurement properties.<br /><br />In
                addition, the model RMSE, true standard deviation, separation
                and person reliability were also examined. The model RMSE, which
                measures the discrepancy between the observed data and the
                expected responses of the model, was 0.79, indicating a good
                fit. The true standard deviation was 1.06, similar to the
                previous analysis, indicating consistent measurement properties.
                The separation was 1.34, indicating the ability of the
                measurement instrument to discriminate between individuals with
                different expressions of the latent trait. The person
                reliability of 0.64 indicates an acceptable level of measurement
                reliability.<br /><br />The correlation between the raw score
                and the measured score was 0.91, indicating a strong positive
                relationship. This result indicates that the items of the
                measurement instrument effectively capture the underlying
                construct of awareness, perception and acceptance of NDI
                services. The high Cronbach’s alpha (KR-20) of 0.92 demonstrates
                the internal consistency and reliability of the measurement,
                indicating that the items measure the same construct and
                consistently provide reliable responses. The standardised
                reliability coefficient of 0.77 further confirms the good
                reliability of the measurement.<br /><br />The analysis also
                identified certain items that were misfits in relation to the
                Rasch model. These inappropriate items, ranked by their degree
                of misfit, can be revised or removed to improve the validity of
                the measurement instrument. In addition, Differential Item
                Functioning (DIF) analysis revealed significant differences in
                item performance between men and women on several items. This
                suggests that gender factors may influence people’s responses to
                the items and should be taken into account in further research
                or when interpreting the results.<br />

                The cross-tabulation analysis between the respondents’
                statements and the questions on awareness, perception and
                acceptance of NDI services revealed several important findings.
                <br /><br />
                Significant differences were found in the use of identity
                systems, particularly RFID, biometrics, and electronic
                signatures, based on demographic and socio-economic factors.
                Gender, marital status, ethnicity/race, work status, employment
                sector, education level, place of residence, income level, and
                country of residence were found to play a role in the use of
                identity systems. However, factors such as password/ PIN and IP
                address were not influenced by demographic factors.
                <br /><br />
                In terms of the warned risks of identification systems, most
                factors showed no significant association, with the exception of
                gender, which was associated with the risk of unauthorised
                access to personal data.
                <br /><br />
                Awareness of the NDII was significantly related to gender, age,
                ethnicity/ race, work status, employment sector, education
                level, income level and country of residence. Targeted efforts
                are needed to increase awareness of specific demographic groups.
                <br /><br />
                Across all demographics, the expected benefits of services such
                as the NDI, such as minimal user burden, ease of task
                completion, secure identification, cost savings, control of
                personal information and identity fraud, were found to be
                significant. Demographic considerations are important for the
                development and marketing of similar services.
                <br /><br />
                Factors such as ethnicity/race, work status and income level had
                the greatest impact on the attractiveness of NDI users.
                Providing options for managing personal data, ensuring complete
                confidentiality and using biometrics were identified as
                effective strategies. Gender, age, marital status, education
                level and place of residence were less important in attracting
                users. To attract more users, the NDI service should prioritise
                the management of personal information, confidentiality and the
                integration of biometric data, while taking into account factors
                such as ethnicity/race, work status and income level.
                <br /><br />
                In terms of gender, women were more familiar with identity
                systems, with the exception of IP addresses. Password/ PIN and
                biometrics were the most familiar, while RFID and electronic
                signatures were the least familiar. Women also expressed more
                concern about risks and expected more benefits from NDI.
                Preferences for a free service with options to manage personal
                data, shorter waiting times, a simple registration process,
                complete confidentiality, annual system audits and the
                integration of biometrics were expressed more often by women
                than by men.
                <br /><br />
                In terms of age, the 15 to 29 age group was familiar with
                passwords/ PIN, RFID and biometrics, while the 30 to 39 age
                group was well familiar with all identity systems. Familiarity
                decreased with age and concern about risk was high across all
                age groups, with the 30 to 39 age group showing the greatest
                concern. Those aged 30 to 39 also gave the most positive
                responses about the benefits of NDI. Across all age groups, the
                reasons cited for attracting more users were the free provision
                of the service, control of personal data, shorter waiting times,
                an easy sign-up process, confidentiality, system audits and the
                integration of biometrics. Those aged 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 gave
                more positive responses for control of personal information,
                ease of subscription and system audits.
                <br /><br />
                Among the different marital status groups, married people had
                the highest positive responses for all identity systems and
                risks. Divorced participants showed the lowest positive
                responses and a lower preference for biometrics.
                <br /><br />
                In terms of race/ethnicity, Malays had the highest familiarity
                and most positive responses for multiple systems and risks,
                while Chinese respondents showed scepticism in certain areas.
                Malays also gave the most positive responses on benefits,
                followed by Bumiputra from Sabah/Sarawak. All ethnic groups
                preferred a free service and absolute confidentiality.
                Biometrics, personal information management, shorter waiting
                times, an easy registration process and system audits were only
                moderately important.
                <br /><br />
                In terms of occupational status, respondents in managerial
                positions were the most familiar with identity systems, while
                pensioners had the least familiarity with them. Skilled workers
                had the highest number of respondents who were not familiar with
                any system. All occupational groups were aware of the risks
                associated with identification systems, with hacking being the
                biggest problem. Respondents in managerial positions showed the
                highest awareness of risk, while pensioners and
                non-professionals showed the lowest. Respondents in senior
                positions also gave the most positive responses for all
                benefits, and preferences for a free service, control of
                personal data, shorter waiting times, an easy login process,
                confidentiality, system audits and biometrics were the same
                across employment, with respondents in senior positions giving
                the most positive responses.
                <br /><br />
                Among the different employment sectors, the private sector had
                the highest familiarity with all identity systems, followed by
                the government sector. Perceptions of risk varied across
                sectors. The private sector expressed more concern about
                embarrassing details and credit card fraud, while the government
                sector focused on unauthorised access and misuse of information.
                Private sector respondents gave the most positive responses for
                all benefits. Preferences for a free service, control over
                personal data, shorter waiting times, an easy sign-up process,
                confidentiality, system audits and biometrics were the same
                across all sectors, with the private sector giving the most
                positive responses.
                <br /><br />
                Respondents with higher levels of education, especially diploma
                and university graduates, were more positive about all identity
                systems. Higher levels of education were also associated with
                greater awareness of the risks associated with identification
                systems. However, a significant proportion of respondents at all
                education levels expressed uncertainty about the risks,
                indicating a need for further education and awareness-raising.
                Among the education groups, respondents with a university degree
                had the highest number of positive responses and showed the most
                positive attitudes towards the benefits and policies of the NDI
                service.
                <br /><br />
                In terms of place of residence, both urban and rural residents
                reported being familiar with passwords/PINs, but were mostly
                unaware of RFID. Biometrics and IP addresses were more familiar
                to rural residents. In terms of benefits, rural respondents were
                more likely to agree with minimal user effort, simplification of
                tasks, secure identification, cost savings, control of personal
                data and detection of identity fraud. Both urban and rural
                respondents agreed that providing the service for free, managing
                personal data, reducing waiting time, simplifying the enrolment
                process, ensuring confidentiality, conducting system checks and
                using biometrics for selfverification attracted more users.
                <br /><br />
                Respondents showed familiarity with different identity systems,
                with passwords/PINs and RFID being the most familiar.
                Familiarity varied by income level, with higher-income
                individuals more familiar with most systems. Respondents with
                higher incomes were more aware of the risks associated with
                identification systems. Respondents with a household income of
                less than RM4,850 had the most positive responses. Most
                respondents from all income levels believed in the benefits of
                NDI-like services. The factors that attract more users were the
                same across all income strata.
                <br /><br />
                In terms of state of residence, passwords/ PINs were the most
                popular identity system in all states, with Pahang having the
                highest usage. RFID, biometrics, IP addresses and electronic
                signatures were less popular. Respondents were aware of the
                risks, with differences between states. Kelantan had the highest
                number of positive responses among the resident state groups.
                Most respondents agreed with the benefits, such as minimal user
                effort, simplicity of tasks, secure identification, cost
                savings, control of personal information and detection of
                identity fraud. Responses varied by strategy, with Pahang and
                Kelantan receiving the most positive responses in some cases.
                Biometrics for self-verification was generally preferred, with

                The study’s findings and analysis have significant implications
                for promoting awareness and adoption of the Malaysian NDII.
                Targeted awareness campaigns are essential to ensure widespread
                understanding and acceptance of the NDI. The study shows that
                demographic factors such as gender, age, marital status,
                ethnicity/race, education level, and place of residence are
                associated with awareness levels. Policymakers should tailor
                their outreach efforts to specific demographic groups, drawing
                on the effectiveness of targeted campaigns demonstrated in
                previous research.

                Addressing privacy and security concerns is critical to building
                trust and acceptance of the NDII. Participants expressed
                significant concerns about online privacy and data security. To
                address these concerns and build public trust, policymakers
                should prioritise robust security measures, transparent data
                processing practises and clear privacy information. This is in
                line with the findings of previous research, such as the study
                by Elaswad and Jensen (2016), which highlights the importance of
                addressing privacy and security concerns in strengthening public
                trust in digital identity systems. Policymakers should
                prioritise the implementation of robust security measures,
                transparent data processing practises and clear privacy
                information to address concerns and increase trust in the NDII.

                The study highlights the importance of a user-friendly design
                for the NDII. Participants emphasised minimal user effort, ease
                of task execution and secure identification. Policymakers should
                prioritise intuitive interfaces, streamlined processes and clear
                instructions to ensure easy navigation and use of NDI services.
                This emphasis on ease of use and usability is consistent with
                previous studies that have shown it to have a significant impact
                on the adoption and acceptance of digital identity systems (Sule
                et al., 2021). Policymakers should prioritise intuitive
                interfaces, streamlined processes and clear instructions to
                ensure that citizens can easily navigate and use NDI services,
                thus improving user acceptance and adoption.<br />

                The use of biometric technologies in the NDII can increase
                security and user convenience, leading to greater adoption.
                Participants were positive about identification systems that
                incorporate biometrics. Policymakers should consider
                incorporating biometric authentication methods such as
                fingerprint or facial recognition based on the findings and
                recommendations of previous research. Previous research, such as
                the study by Nnamoko et al. (2022), suggests that the inclusion
                of biometrics in digital identity systems can increase security
                and user convenience, leading to greater adoption. Policymakers
                should consider using biometric technologies such as fingerprint
                or facial recognition as part of the NDII to provide secure and
                user-friendly authentication methods.

                Several recommendations are made to promote awareness and
                acceptance of the NDII. First, the Malaysian government should
                launch a comprehensive education and awareness campaign
                targeting all age groups, genders, and income levels. Messages
                should be tailored to the needs of specific groups to maximise
                effectiveness. In addition, the NDII should be inclusive and
                accessible to all. People with disabilities and those who are
                not computer literate should receive support. User-friendly
                interfaces and assistance should be provided to facilitate use.
              </div>
              <div
                id="text_block-159-37"
                class="ct-text-block text-justify text-manuscript-body mrgn-bttm-2"
              >
                Integrating the NDII with existing services such as banking and
                health services would increase convenience and reduce
                duplication of personal data. This integration would result in
                faster service and less paperwork for citizens. In addition,
                demographic-specific recommendations can optimise awareness and
                acceptance efforts. Targeted outreach programmes should be
                implemented for women, different age groups, couples and
                families, different ethnic groups and communities, employed and
                unemployed people, specific employment sectors, different levels
                of education and regions with lower digital literacy.<br />

              >
                The implementation of these recommendations will help overcome
                barriers, raise awareness, address concerns and promote
                acceptance and adoption of the NDII. In this way, Malaysia can
                create a secure and user-friendly digital identity ecosystem
                that benefits all citizens.<br />

                In conclusion, the study’s findings and analysis provide
                valuable insights into the factors that influence awareness,
                perception, and acceptance of the Malaysian NDII. The study
                highlights the need for targeted awareness campaigns aimed at
                specific demographic groups, building on previous research that
                emphasises the effectiveness of such campaigns in increasing
                public awareness and knowledge of digital identity schemes.
                <br /><br />
                Privacy and security concerns emerged as significant barriers to
                the adoption of the NDII. This highlights the importance of
                implementing robust security measures, transparent data
                processing practices and clear communication about privacy. The
                study also highlights the importance of user-friendly design.
                Participants emphasised minimal user effort, ease of task
                completion and secure identification. The use of biometric
                technologies in the NDII is recommended due to the positive
                perception of such authentication methods by the participants.
                <br /><br />
                To promote awareness and acceptance of the NDII, it is
                recommended to launch comprehensive education and awareness
                campaigns for all demographic groups, ensure inclusion and
                accessibility through user-friendly interfaces and support for
                people with disabilities, and integrate the NDII into existing
                services to increase convenience. Demographic-specific
                recommendations further optimise awareness and acceptance
                efforts.
                <br /><br />
                As the Malaysian government prepares to implement the NDII,
                future research is recommended to address various aspects and
                challenges. These include exploring the policy and regulatory
                frameworks needed to support the initiative, focusing on
                user-centred design to improve the user experience, engaging
                stakeholders and conducting public awareness campaigns,
                developing implementation strategies and a comprehensive
                roadmap, and considering technological aspects such as digital
                infrastructure, interoperability and emerging technologies.
                <br /><br />
                Addressing these research areas can help policymakers and
                stakeholders gain valuable insights into the development,
                implementation, and roll-out of the NDII in Malaysia. This will
                help create a secure and user-friendly digital identity
                ecosystem that benefits all citizens by providing convenient
                access to services and promoting trust in the digital world.
