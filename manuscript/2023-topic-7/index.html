                The growth of e-commerce is the main factor driving the postal
                and courier industries. The modern customer is becoming more
                conscious of their rights. A few years ago, consumers made
                purchases without considering whether the goods met their
                expectations. Consumers today expect postal and courier services
                to provide high-quality service. Therefore, a study on consumer
                expectations and experience in postal article safety through
                last-mile delivery for the postal and courier industry has been
                conducted. Qualitative and quantitative research with a sample
                of 245 respondents are used in the study. The study is also
                analysed statistically using gap analysis and Importance
                Performance Analysis (IPA). The results showed a significant gap
                between expectations and experiences in all five (5) dimensions
                of service quality. With regards to the IPA matrix, service
                quality attributes were in the four (4) quadrants. Furthermore,
                the study highlighted 10 issues and challenges in ensuring
                parcel safety complies with the requirement. The negative gap in
                all dimensions of quality shows that quality improvement is
                necessary in all dimensions. Using service quality measurement
                instruments, IPA analysis will help courier service providers
                plan service quality improvement and achieve long-term goals.

                In the competitive, service-oriented business environment of
                today, every company needs to strive to satisfy its clients by
                providing the best possible quality. The long-term success of a
                corporate organisation is mostly dependent on its customers. The
                postal and courier services must offer their customers valuable,
                high-quality services. The courier service providers are
                fortifying their positions and pursuing expansion by investing
                in e-commerce logistics, such as the use of cutting-edge
                logistics technologies and revitalising the supply delivery
                system, to match this demand and stay competitive in the
                difficult market as it has evolved from door-to-door to
                self-service using information technology and sophisticated
                logistical solutions. Alongside the e-commerce industry, the
                postal and courier market is growing rapidly, generating
                significant earnings for the industry. The e-commerce business
                is growing at an exponential rate, which presents both
                opportunities and challenges for online retailers and logistics
                companies. Due to the rising popularity of e-commerce, there has
                been a tremendous growth in consumer demand for express delivery
                services. However, the number of complaints from customers using
                postal and courier services has increased along with Malaysia’s
                growing demand for online business. For instance, it rose by 70
                per cent between 2018 and 2019. In 2018, there were 1,235
                complaints, while in 2019, there were 2,102 (MCMC, 2019). As
                last-mile delivery is a critical step in getting products to
                their destination, which is usually the customer’s doorstep,
                improving the quality of the services provided is therefore
                imperative. During this phase, a company’s reputation can be
                made or broken by its effectiveness and customer experience. To
                enhance last-mile delivery, businesses are looking for creative
                solutions as customer demands rise. Accordingly, the study aims
                to investigate the consumers’ experience in the last mile of a
                parcel delivery service that considers consumers’ experiences
                with last-mile delivery.<br />

                When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the movement control order
                disrupted domestic and international supply networks.
                Unintentionally, this increased the need for online purchasing,
                pushing companies to use e-commerce to stay in business. The
                postal and courier sector in Malaysia has grown rapidly in
                recent years, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting
                consumer behaviour, and the rise of e-commerce platforms. The
                logistics sector serves an ever-growing number of customers,
                mostly in the last-mile delivery sector, because of Malaysia’s
                e-commerce industry’s explosive growth. E-commerce is predicted
                by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)
                to increase from 14 parcels per capita in 2020 to 30 parcels per
                capita by 2025, and this rise is anticipated to continue. Even
                though the growth trend is favourable, many courier companies
                are finding it difficult to capitalise on the growing demand for
                their services because of intense competition and industry
                pressure to reduce service rates (Defry et al., 2022). Due to
                fierce competition and a protracted price war, many courier
                businesses, especially small ones are finding it challenging to
                profit from the growing demand for their services, despite their
                extensive awareness in the booming e-commerce market. The rise
                in parcel volume and market demands for reasonably priced
                services have led to a decline in last-mile delivery performance
                in the postal industry, which has raised consumer discontent
                with the security and timeliness of postal deliveries (Lei, et
                al., 2022). Furthermore, shifting business methods have also
                seriously impacted the last mile concept.
                <br /><br />
                Late deliveries, parcels that are delivered in unsatisfactory
                circumstances, and missing or misplaced parcels are the most
                frequent issues. Because of this, MCMC saw a sharp increase in
                complaints from customers who were unhappy with the security and
                delivery of their postal items because of the growing volume of
                packages and pressure from the market to provide services at
                competitive prices. There has been a notable increase in the
                number of complaints received by MCMC about postal and courier
                services during the last three (3) years (2016-2018). In 2018,
                MCMC received 1,235 complaints, which is seven (7) times higher
                than the 143 complaints received in 2015 (MCMC, 2019). Among the
                complaints eceived are issues such as missing items, poor
                service, late deliveries, poor customer support, unfair prices,
                refunds, and other related delivery issues.<br />

                The intense rivalry has arisen in the postal and courier sector
                due to the quickly expanding e- commerce parcel market, the
                inevitable collapse of the traditional core business of mail
                delivery as communications shift online, and other digital
                issues that the industry must continue to handle. Malaysia has a
                substantial amount of untapped potential for the advancement of
                the e-commerce industry, which is partially explained by its
                improved internet connection, high mobile penetration rate, and
                increased security (Halo, 2022). Businesses in the supply chain,
                such as courier firms that provide parcel delivery services, can
                benefit greatly from the expanding e-commerce sector (Siali,
                Wen, &amp; Hajazi, 2018). The increasing popularity of online
                shopping has played a major role in the growth of courier
                services in recent years (Gulc, 2020). There is fierce
                competition among Malaysia’s postal and courier service
                providers since the sector is headed towards becoming a
                competitive market. Malaysia is home to many domestic and
                foreign businesses, all striving to increase their market share
                in this sector. Concurrent with the growing popularity of online
                shopping and the sporadic massive e-marketplace discount days,
                the courier service providers enhanced their services and
                handling. These developments were fuelled by digitally connected
                consumers who are always looking for better deals on products
                and delivery fees, increased convenience, and a seamless
                experience. According to a new analysis by Mordor Intelligence,
                the postal and courier market in Malaysia is predicted to rise
                from USD1.32 billion (RM6.18 billion) in 2023 to USD2.55 billion
                (RM11.94 billion) by 2028.<br />

                The service sector makes the tough decision to assess service
                quality through the “eyes” of its customers (Arora &amp; Arora,
                2015). The service industry can grow quickly if it can offer
                higher-quality services. In summary, there is a distinction
                between a service’s quality and the performance standards that
                its clients hold it to. Since it gives informative information
                about how customers perceive services, the idea of service
                quality continues to be an important subject of research in
                marketing (Joshi &amp; Chadha, 2016). When referring to quality
                in the context of services, it means assessing the services
                holistically, considering things like performance, features,
                compliance, durability, serviceability, and other
                quality-related factors (Parasuraman, 1988). By evaluating
                service quality, businesses can gain a competitive advantage and
                evaluate their place in the market. Berry et al. (1994) claim
                that SERVQUAL is a helpful tool for supporting organisations in
                their pursuit of quality improvement by highlighting areas that
                are critical to improvement. Parasuraman (1988) states that the
                SERVQUAL instrument’s dimensions can be applied in several
                industries.<br />

                According to Mei et al. (2018), one (1) important factor
                influencing service quality is the tangibles dimension. The
                tangible aspects of the service environment can significantly
                impact a customer’s affective response and behavioural
                intention. In a similar element, customers’ initial impression
                of a service is based on its physical surroundings (Pantouvakis
                &amp; Lymperopoulos, 2008). In the same opinion, Markovic et al.
                (2011) argued that tangibles are more crucial for services with
                more tangible characteristics. Some aspects set courier services
                apart from regular mail services. The characteristics of courier
                services set them apart from regular mail services. Three (3)
                elements related to tangibility are availability, personnel, and
                assets. Personnel refers to workers who produce the service and
                assist in the management of courier service operations, whereas
                assets are defined as tangible tools, operational methods
                outlets’ locations, and websites (Roslan et al., 2015). Any tool
                that signals the presence of service during the delivery process
                is referred to as being available.<br />

                Responsiveness, or the speed and accuracy with which courier
                service providers handle consumer inquiries and transactions, is
                a crucial component of service excellence. It involves giving
                customers clear information and actively listening to them to
                fulfil their responsibilities (Hu et al., 2012). The studied
                literature provides valuable insights into the importance of
                responsiveness as a constituent of service quality, its impact
                on customer satisfaction, and its role in shaping customer
                behaviour. Research conducted across numerous countries and
                industries offers a comprehensive understanding of the factors
                influencing service quality, customer satisfaction, and channel

                seeking to enhance their service offerings and customer
                experiences. When referring to courier services, this could
                refer to the reaction that a courier service provider provides
                to its customers. If an employee had no justification for
                keeping their customers waiting, they would perceive them
                negatively.<br />

                The provision of safety and guarantee by courier service
                providers is referred to as assurance. Additional components of
                assurance include capability, kindness, validity, and security.
                When clients receive services, the professionalism and degree of
                expertise of the workforce are crucial factors in providing
                assurance. Furthermore, employees must be able to inspire
                confidence and trust in customers (Izogo &amp; Ogba, 2015). When
                answering inquiries, complaints, and other correspondence from
                customers, staff members must be courteous. This occurred
                because customers chose to patronise other companies instead of
                returning to the former one after becoming dissatisfied and
                uneasy with the service rendered by an employee. The fact that
                consumers prefer to do business with persons or organisations
                they can trust serves as evidence for this. It takes this
                dimension to guarantee customers’ happiness.<br />

                According to Izogo and Ogba (2015), empathy is the capacity to
                focus on the requirements, wants, and difficulties of the
                customer and to successfully address their desires, relate to
                the issues suitably, show concern for them, and come up with
                solutions. In the words of Rishi, Deepak, and Suyash (2017),
                empathy includes things like offering outstanding customer
                service, considering the customer’s preferences, and
                accommodating business hours. A study reported by Kasiri et al.
                (2017), there is a relationship between empathy and customer
                satisfaction. Another benefit that gives customers confidence
                and trust while also boosting loyalty is empathy. In every
                scenario, staff members ought to be deeply engaged with the
                clients. Consequently, this is a means by which the business
                should take pride in providing customers with a personalised,
                exceptional, and valued experience to win their loyalty through
                empathy and highquality service.<br />

                The ability of a courier service provider to honestly and
                consistently provide the goods and services that are agreed upon
                is referred to as reliability (Ngo and Nguyen, 2016). Customers
                will be happy when trustworthy services are provided.
                Reliability is the ability to reliably deliver services as
                promised, accurately, and on schedule. It entails having the
                capacity to resolve issues, manage transactions safely, and
                greatly affect the motivation of customers to make purchases
                (Chang et al., 2016). The factors influencing customers’ use of
                express delivery services which is a crucial last-mile delivery
                route were the main subject of Zhong, Lomas, and Worth’s (2021)
                analysis. The findings demonstrated that customers’ behaviour
                and inclination to use an express delivery service are
                positively influenced by their performance expectations
                regarding delivery reliability. From the standpoint of courier
                services, reliability can be evaluated by the number of times a
                parcel is delivered to its intended location and by the length
                of time it takes to deliver it.<br />

                In this study, qualitative and quantitative are employed. As for
                qualitative research design, this study employs documentary
                analysis to investigate contextual insights within existing
                textual materials related to parcel delivery services, such as
                journal and industry publications. By adopting documentary
                analysis within the specific context of parcel delivery
                services, the research seeks to enrich our understanding of the
                subject matter, providing nuanced insights to contribute to the
                existing body of knowledge in parcel delivery services. For the
                quantitative method, respondents were selected based on their
                experience and perception of using postal and courier services.
                Those who have used such services are chosen as they can provide
                insights into their experiences. Section A of the questionnaire
                covered the demographic information of the respondents, while
                the next section inquired about service quality, particularly on
                expectations and experiences using courier services. Each item
                was measured with the 5-point Likert Scale (1 = Strongly
                Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). Another section is asking about
                the issues and challenges in courier services. A total of 245
                respondents were collected. The mean scores for each service
                quality dimension (in both expectations and experiences aspects)
                were calculated. The quality gap was calculated by deducting the
                expectation and experience scores. Additionally,
                Importance-performance analysis (IPA), developed by Martilla and
                James (1977) was used to determine which characteristics were
                low-performing and needed intervention to raise the quality of
                services provided by the courier service providers, as well as
                which characteristics were high-performing and demonstrated the
                strength of the courier service providers. The scores of the
                expectations and experiences were determined for each quality
                attribute based on consumers’ perspectives.<br /><br />Each
                quadrant of this matrix provides a strategic guide to help
                courier service providers perceive the consumers’ concerns, as
                well as the necessary steps to boost customer satisfaction. The
                attributes assigned to Quadrant I (areas to be improved) have
                high expectations but low experience indicating the failure of
                the courier service provider to meet the consumer’s perceived
                performance in this area. The attributes with both high
                expectations and experience fall into the Quadrant II (need to
                be monitored) representing the core strengths of the courier
                service providers. The Quadrant III (low preference) belongs to
                the attributes with both low expectation and experience. It
                shows courier service providers should be a low priority because
                the average expectation for these attributes is the same as the
                average experience overall. Attributes with low experience and
                high performance are placed into the Quadrant IV (possible
                overkill) indicating the minor strengths. It suggests that
                courier service providers might be overkill given that the
                average anticipation for these attributes is lower than the
                average experience overall.<br />

                The analysis of participant demographics reveals a diverse
                cross-section of respondents across various categories. The
                gender distribution within the sample population indicates a
                slightly higher representation of females (59.2 per cent)
                compared to males (40.8 per cent). Age-wise, the majority of
                respondents fall within the 18-29 years bracket, constituting
                43.7 per cent of the sample, followed by descending percentages
                in subsequent age groups. The racial composition highlights a
                predominant representation of individuals from the Malay ethnic
                group (71.4 per cent), with notable percentages from Chinese
                (14.7 per cent), Indian (11.8 per cent), and “Others” (2 per
                cent) ethnicities. In terms of educational attainment, a
                significant proportion holds Bachelor’s degrees (50.6 per cent),
                followed by Master’s degrees (22.4 per cent), while smaller
                percentages possess Diploma/STPM/ A-Level qualifications (17.1
                per cent), Doctoral degrees (6.1 per cent), or SPM/ MCE/O-Level
                certificates (3.7 per cent). Professionally, this research
                covers a diverse range. Of the respondents, 29.4 per cent were
                students, followed by people from the private sector (27.8 per
                cent) and people from the public sector (20 per cent). There is
                also a proportion of self-employed people (13.9 per cent),
                pensioners (4.9 per cent), housewives (3.3 per cent), and a
                minimal proportion of unemployed people (0.8 per cent). The
                income distribution shows a diverse range, with the majority
                earning less than RM2,500 (44.5 per cent) and the smaller
                percentage earning more than RM15,040 (2.9 per cent).
                Collectively, these results represent a diverse and multifaceted
                participant pool and provide comprehensive insight into the
                demographics of our survey respondents.

                The assessment of residential types conducted in the study shows
                a diverse distribution among the participants. According to the
                data, most people live in terraced houses (25.3 per cent,
                followed closely by those living in bungalows (19.0 per cent).
                Regarding institutional residential, a significant proportion of
                respondents (20.4 per cent) lived in public universities,
                suggesting a significant presence of students and people
                associated with these institutions. However, minimal proportions
                were observed at private universities (0.8 per cent), graduate
                universities (2 per cent), technical colleges (4.9 per cent),
                and community colleges (1.2 per cent), this indicates relatively
                low participation among people in the country. A significant
                proportion of those surveyed live in various types of apartments
                or housing complexes. This includes residents of
                apartments/apartments/condos with doorstep delivery (12.2 per
                cent), serviced apartments (1.2 per cent), studio apartments
                (1.2 per cent), and SOHO residents. (Small offices/home offices)
                (1.2 per cent), semi-detached houses (3.3 per cent), cluster
                houses (2.0 per cent), townhouses (2.2 per cent), villas (1.2
                per cent). Additionally, a small proportion live in other
                housing types classified as ‘other’ (0.2 per cent). The
                distribution of residential types within the study population
                shows a wide range of housing preferences and housing types. The
                prevalence of singlefamily houses such as terraced houses and
                bungalows indicates that a significant proportion of people live
                in traditional housing structures. On the contrary, the
                existence of various types of residents, such as apartments,
                housing complexes, and institutional housing complexes, shows
                the diversity of living styles and ways of living. This diverse
                housing representation in survey data can potentially impact
                various aspects such as accessibility to amenities, community
                dynamics, and lifestyle preferences.

                Every country place equal emphasis on localised distribution
                when it comes to parcel delivery to local distribution hubs that
                are nearest to the recipient’s residence. Efficiency and
                convenience are prioritised in this worldwide approach for the
                final distribution stage. Despite their disparate geographic
                origins, all countries recognise the importance of being close
                to the recipient’s location, which is crucial for optimising the
                last-mile delivery process. Two (2) prominent countries that
                have implemented centralised distribution centres are Singapore
                and the United Kingdom. In the UK, parcels are routed through
                distribution centres and delivery depots, expediting the sorting
                process, and preparing deliveries for dispatch. Singapore, on
                the other hand, adopts a coordinated approach by offering
                delivery to regional hubs, specified parcel collection
                locations, or local distribution hubs. China adopts a
                comprehensive strategy that includes the use of distribution
                centres for the final phase of delivery. This approach takes
                into consideration the vast geographical expanse of China and
                ensures efficient parcel handling at both local and federal
                levels. In contrast, India employs a decentralised approach,
                directing items to distribution centres and decentralising
                last-mile delivery. This strategy aligns with India’s diverse
                topography and population concentrations. While all of these
                countries are committed to enhancing local delivery services,
                they employ different techniques for parcel preparation and
                sorting.

                The sorting and processing methods utilised by various postal
                administrations exhibit both similarities and unique strategies.
                In Malaysia, items undergo meticulous categorisation in central
                or regional facilities based on their dimensions, weight, and
                intended purpose. This meticulous sorting underscores Malaysia’s
                commitment to maintaining a wellorganised supply chain.
                Similarly, in the UK, parcels undergo sorting at distribution
                centres according to their respective destinations, with
                realtime processing employed. This approach underscores the UK’s
                dedication to achieving efficient and prompt package
                classification. In contrast, China, India, and the US all employ
                centralised sorting methods. The US Postal Service, for
                instance, prioritises a centralised and streamlined sorting
                process. Parcels are categorised at sorting facilities based on
                their size and destination, aiming to optimise transit
                efficiency.

                For Malaysia, the UK, Singapore, and China, the importance of
                obtaining a signature or confirmation of delivery is emphasised.
                This shared practice underscores the commitment to ensuring the
                safe and reliable completion of the last-mile delivery process.
                Meanwhile, the UK is unique as it employs a hybrid approach,
                utilising both local courier services and postal workers for
                last-mile deliveries. This dual technique provides process
                flexibility in the distribution process by utilising the
                benefits of both services. As opposed to this, last-mile
                delivery in the US, Singapore, and India primarily relies on the
                dedicated work of postal workers or staff. The streamlined
                approach centralises accountability for the parcel service and
                ensures a seamless and effective delivery process. These
                distinctions highlight the varying strategies employed in
                last-mile delivery across different countries.

                Malaysia distinguishes itself by emphasising the utilisation of
                mobile apps for notifications and tracking, demonstrating a
                strong commitment to leveraging mobile technology as a
                convenient avenue for delivering realtime updates. On the other
                hand, Singapore provides comprehensive package notifications
                along with tracking information, showcasing a proactive approach
                to customer service. The inclusion of web portal alerts in
                China, however, indicates a reliance on online communication
                channels and a preference for centralised digital channels,
                which may enhance the efficiency and uniformity of notification

                If the first delivery is unsuccessful, all the aforementioned
                countries (Malaysia, the United Kingdom, the United States of
                America, Singapore, China, and India) routinely offer options
                for redelivery or pickup from designated locations. This
                flexibility has been put in place to provide options for
                redelivery or pickup from designated locations. This flexibility
                is implemented to offer consumers convenient alternatives for
                receiving their items. In Malaysia, the parcel service takes the
                initiative to try and redeliver the package. If unsuccessful,
                arrangements are made for consumers to conveniently pick up the
                parcel from a nearby parcel office. This proactive approach
                ensures multiple opportunities for successful delivery. The UK
                postal service provides a number of choices for recipients in
                the event that a delivery is not successful. Consumers can ask
                for a redelivery or pick up the undelivered item from nearby
                offices. This flexibility allows for the varied schedules and
                preferences of the consumers. When parcels from the US postal
                service are returned undeliverable, consumers can choose to have
                them picked up at a nearby post office or request a redelivery.
                This customer-centric strategy ensures that consumers have
                control over the delivery process. In Singapore, parcel
                consumers have the choice of picking up their parcels from
                pre-designated locations or requesting a redelivery. This
                adaptability meets the various needs of the consumers by letting
                them select the most practical method of delivery.

                Consumers in all the countries namely Malaysia, the UK, the US,
                Singapore, China, and India may submit online claims for
                compensation. This indicates a shared commitment to enhancing
                consumer convenience through digital media. To initiate a
                compensation claim, consumers must provide specific data and
                related documentation in every country, ensuring a consistent
                process for claim validation and handling. Consumers in Malaysia
                and India can start the compensation claim process by going to
                their local distribution hub. Those who like in-person
                interactions and assistance may find satisfaction in this
                traditional approach. Consumers in the US have the option of
                visiting their local post office or utilising the online claims
                procedure. This two-pronged strategy offers options according to
                personal tastes and practicality. Singapore and the UK both
                place a strong emphasis on online submissions made through
                specific portals. This demonstrates a more sophisticated digital
                infrastructure, resulting in an accessible and effective claims
                procedure. Consumers in China have the option of submitting
                their claims online or in person at post offices. This
                adaptability considers the customer base’s varied tastes and
                level of technology access. Meanwhile, the US distinguishes
                itself by offering a tangible claims form to its clients. For
                individuals who might prefer a more conventional, paper-based
                technique, an alternate way is available. Other nations do not
                specifically mention using a paper claims form; instead, they
                mostly rely on online submissions. The focus on online
                procedures is consistent with the worldwide movement towards
                digitalisation. This comparison and contrast show a dedication
                to provide a variety of choices for clients to file compensation
                claims by highlighting a blend of traditional and digital ways
                across various nations.

                The comparison reveals that every country employs a range of
                transport methods, indicating a comprehensive approach to meet
                diverse delivery needs. Postal trucks are utilised by all
                countries, demonstrating the critical role that specialised
                postal transportation resources play. On the other hand, only
                the US incorporates airplanes into its transportation mix,
                indicating a greater reliance on air travel for efficient parcel
                delivery. Private courier services are occasionally used by the
                UK, adding another layer of collaboration with outside vendors.
                Due to its vast size, China places emphasis on a combination of
                local delivery services and postal vehicles built to handle the
                nation’s diverse landscapes.

                This study examines the differences between consumers’
                expectations and their experiences about several service quality
                factors, including tangibility, responsiveness, assurance,
                empathy, and reliability. The mean scores for the expectation
                and experience quality gap have been shown in Table 3.
                Accordingly, the gaps between the importance and performance
                were negative in all the dimensions. Consumers had high
                standards for tangible features; they expected aesthetically
                pleasing physical components and high-quality infrastructure,
                with a mean score of 4.29 predicted. On the other hand, the
                average of the reported encounters was 3.91, suggesting a
                significant difference. This disparity indicates that to improve
                overall customer satisfaction and more closely match customers’
                expectations, the physical presentation of services may need to
                be refined. The findings imply that although concrete elements
                like the state of vehicles and facilities and responsiveness are
                important, they occasionally fail to live up to customer
                expectations.<br /><br />The projected score for responsiveness
                to consumer needs was 4.35, which demonstrated high
                expectations. However, the experiences recorded an average score
                that was a little lower, 3.88. This shows that there is space
                for improvement in terms of response times, problem-solving, and
                general customer service to better meet the high standards set
                by customers. This suggests that to guarantee that these factors
                continuously contribute favourably to satisfaction, more focus
                has to be placed on optimising them. Expected assurance in
                service interactions was high, with a mean score of 4.42. The
                mean score for the experiences was 4.04, which is marginally
                lower than expected and indicates a moderate level of pleasure.
                Enhancing features like security, dependability, and
                trustworthiness may increase customer satisfaction and
                confidence. Giving customers clear and precise information has
                been shown to have a beneficial effect on their level of
                satisfaction overall. When they obtain trustworthy information,
                customers appreciate the confidence and faith courier service
                providers engender in them. Consequently, strengthening
                assurance tactics can improve the customer’s experience.<br /><br />The
                service provider has to give greater attention to the empathy
                dimension, as evidenced by the highest mean score of 4.40 on
                consumer expectations. The experiences revealed a mean score of
                4.04, which was somewhat lower but still in close alignment.
                Enhancing compassionate methods of customer service could
                improve the customer experience even further. Our results
                support the idea that sincere and real empathy can strengthen
                the ties between customers and courier service providers,
                resulting in higher levels of customer satisfaction. Therefore,
                it is not only supported but highly urged that the customer
                satisfaction sector emphasise empathy as a fundamental
                component. With a mean score of 4.40, it was estimated that
                service delivery would be highly reliable. The experiences,
                however, revealed a mean score that was marginally lower 4.00
                than expected, indicating a moderate level of satisfaction.
                Improving service delivery characteristics like precision,
                dependability, and consistency could greatly increase total
                customer satisfaction. Customers’ satisfaction with the postal
                service appears to be negatively impacted by elements like
                delays and uneven service quality. This shows that to achieve
                customer expectations, reliability in the context of safety
                needs to be closely examined, with a focus on ongoing
                improvement.<br />

                From the analysis of the score gap, the results of the Top 10
                highest gap as shown in Table 4, improving things like timely
                customer notifications, quick customer service, being available
                to assist customers with problems, and having a dependable
                parcel tracking system are essential for raising the general
                assessment or level of satisfaction with the courier service
                provider. The courier service provider may use these results to
                prioritise areas that need improvement. Taking care of these
                elements that have stronger negative associations may result in
                a more positive assessment or conclusion overall, most likely
                concerning client happiness, trust, or the perceived calibre of
                the courier service.

                Regarding the Top 10 lowest gap results as highlighted in Table
                5, enhancements in areas like updated courier technology,
                courteous and efficient communication about parcel safety,
                understanding of customer demands for safe delivery, provision
                of accurate parcel information, adherence to safety regulations,
                and local knowledge of courier staff members could greatly raise
                the overall assessment or satisfaction with the courier service
                provider. These results may help the courier service provider
                prioritise improvements in these areas, which could improve the
                overall assessment or result. This would probably increase
                customer satisfaction, trust, or the perception of the company’s
                service quality.

                The next step was to perform an Importance-Performance Analysis
                (IPA) matrix to determine which attributes require the greatest
                improvement and to make sure that courier service providers are
                efficiently allocating their services. The IPA matrix was drawn
                after determining the expectation and experience scores of each
                quality dimension and attribute. The matrix is classified into 4
                quadrants as shown in Figure 1 (Quadrant I: Areas to be
                improved, Quadrant II: Needs to be monitored, Quadrant III: Low
                preference, and Quadrant IV: Possible Overkill). Following the
                acquisition of the implicit experience and explicit expectation,
                the IPA matrix was used to plot 37 attributes, with the
                intersection determined by using the mean of 3.98 for experience
                and 4.38 for expectation.

                depicted in Figure 1, the characteristics in Quadrant I
                encompassed seven (7) attributes, namely tangibility (TA6),
                responsiveness (RP4, RP6), assurance (AS1, AS8), and reliability
                (RL 1, RL3). It demonstrates how these characteristics
                positively impact consumer expectations even when their
                experience is viewed as deviating from the norm. Therefore, the
                courier service provider should make extra efforts to improve
                these features and pay special attention to them to ensure that
                parcel safety compliances are met to effectively meet client
                expectations. In addition, 16 attributes associated with
                dimensions including assurance (AS2, AS3, AS4, AS5, AS6, AS7,
                AS9, AS10), empathy (EM1, EM2, EM3, EM4), and reliability (RL4,
                RL5, RL6, RL7) were in Quadrant II. Given that these
                characteristics have greater experience than the mean and
                positively impact consumer expectations, courier service
                providers must continue to provide the same or exceed the level
                of service by periodically assessing the efficacy of their
                offerings.<br /><br />10 attributes, grouped into dimensions
                like tangibility (TA1, TA2, TA3, TA4, TA5) and responsiveness
                (RP1, RP2, RP3, RP7, RP8), were in the Quadrant III. It
                demonstrates how consumers believe these attributes don’t work
                well enough to produce subpar results. These characteristics
                have less of an impact on what consumers expect, therefore
                accepting the service change is not as necessary. Lastly, four
                (4) attributes from dimensions like tangibility (TA7),
                responsiveness (RP5), empathy (EM5), and reliability (RL2) were
                incorporated in Quadrant IV. It demonstrates that, even when
                experience is already above average, these attributes have less
                of an impact on consumer expectations. As stated otherwise,
                these attributes exhibit phenomena of service overload; hence,
                to improve the user experience about parcel safety while taking
                resource constraints into account, service providers must shift
                services from these attributes to those of Quadrant I.<br />

                It is clear from the mean ratings and standard deviations that
                consumers have varying experiences with and perspectives on
                these issues as shown in Table 6. For example, mean ratings in
                the mid-six range indicate significant levels of worry for
                issues including parcel loss, damage, wrong delivery, dishonest
                staff, parcel theft, poor customer service, restricted delivery
                alternatives, and trouble rescheduling deliveries. With a much
                higher mean rating of 7.01, the problem of delivery worker
                impersonation stood out and indicated a greater level of worry
                among respondents. The standard deviations that follow each of
                these concerns show how participants’ experiences or perceptions
                of these obstacles differ in terms of agreement or divergence.

                On the other hand, the descriptive study of the challenges
                performed on difficulties experienced by the delivery service
                sector offers important insights into the perceived problems
                this industry faces. The standard deviations and mean scores
                show that respondents had differing levels of worry about
                certain difficulties. Interestingly, problems including
                low-efficiency levels, inadequate route planning, and
                transparency received higher mean scores, indicating that the
                industry views these problems as more important. In contrast,
                although the mean scores for difficulties such as highly
                competitive markets and price wars were somewhat lower, their
                standard deviations demonstrate a wide variety of opinions among
                participants. The findings highlight the complex and diverse
                nature of issues facing the delivery service industry,
                underscoring the necessity of all-encompassing approaches that
                tackle route planning inefficiencies, guarantee transparency,
                and boost productivity. To further simplify operations and raise
                service standards in this industry, plans should consider the
                market’s dynamic and competitive nature in addition to handling
                process upgrades and tool standardisation.<br /><br />Table 8
                and Table 9 show the results for the t-test and One-Way ANOVA
                respectively. This analysis is to test the issues and challenges
                in ensuring parcel safety during last-mile delivery to different
                demographics comprising types of customers, receiving addresses,
                and other contributors which could affect postal article safety
                and quality of delivery.<br />

                To maintain industry competitiveness and customer satisfaction
                with parcel safety and service quality during last-mile
                delivery, service providers may implement various strategies, as
                highlighted by the findings of the study.<br /><br />Parcels are
                sent to the local distribution hub nearest the consumer’s home,
                ensuring a localised and effective last-mile delivery process on
                the part of the service provider. In addition to giving
                consumers’ convenience top priority, this tactic also cuts down
                on transit times, which raises customer satisfaction levels. The
                emphasis on proximity in its operations makes it a strong
                contender for best practices in postal services, as it reflects
                the service provider’s commitment to optimising the final phase
                of delivery and adopting a customer-centric approach. With this
                implementation strategy, customer satisfaction with parcel
                safety and service quality during last-mile delivery is
                guaranteed.<br /><br />The careful process of classifying
                products at central or regional sorting facilities according to
                size, weight, and intended usage must be implemented by the
                service provider. This method shows the service provider’s
                dedication to a well-organised and efficient sorting procedure
                by guaranteeing that goods are effectively guided to their
                designated destinations. The service provider is a solid
                candidate for recognition in the field of best practices because
                of the methodical sorting criteria, which enhance the postal
                network’s overall efficiency.<br /><br />When it comes to parcel
                delivery, service providers’ employees go above and beyond by
                ensuring confirmation of delivery when required. This commitment
                is made possible by the comprehensive and customer-centric
                strategy they employ. This dedication to verification upholds
                the security and legitimacy of the delivery procedure, fostering
                client happiness and confidence. This is done to make sure that,
                when it comes to last-mile delivery, the safety packet complies
                with global requirements for a trustworthy postal service.<br /><br />It
                might be challenging to meet consumer expectations, particularly
                in the areas of order tracking and delivery alerts. The service
                provider must prioritise integrating technology in a forward-
                thinking manner. Utilising mobile platforms ensures that
                consumers can easily track their packages and receive
                notifications, which is in line with the modern consumer’s
                preference for accessibility while on the go. This approach not
                only improves the user experience but also shows awareness of
                how the digital world is changing.<br /><br />The service
                provider stands out for its proactive approach to attempting
                redelivery and simplifying the parcel pickup process for
                customers at local courier offices. This method lessens
                consumers’ inconvenience while also increasing the likelihood of
                successful deliveries. The focus on offering a variety of
                options helps to guarantee a satisfying consumer experience and
                boosts the postal system’s effectiveness. When implementing
                return and redelivery policies, service providers’ efficiency,
                customer happiness, and adaptability should all be taken into
                account.<br /><br />The service provider’s dedication to
                customer satisfaction is demonstrated by how well it handles
                compensation claims within its postal service. Online
                submissions must be in line with contemporary, customer-focused
                solutions, according to the service provider. Customers can
                easily navigate and submit information using the online
                approach, which speeds the claims processing. This is in line
                with the increasing convenience of relying on digital platforms.
                Recognising the diverse technical environments among their
                customer base, the service provider allows customers to file
                claims online, ensuring accessibility and flexibility in
                interacting with the claims procedure according to their
                preferences.<br /><br />The parcel service provider’s efficient
                and community-focused approach necessitates improving the
                transportation method. The utilisation of postal vans for
                localised delivery to nearby courier offices and distribution
                centres exemplifies a strategic approach that considers the
                nation’s topography. This procedure reduces needless
                transportation and guarantees a prompt last-mile delivery to
                consumers in designated communities. The service provider is
                dedicated to streamlining its transportation processes in order
                to deliver parcels quickly and efficiently.<br />

                The results of the study shed light on the intricate ecosystem
                that surrounds consumer satisfaction. Many significant factors
                have been studied; each has a unique impact on the overall
                customer experience. These components are assurance,
                responsiveness, empathy, tangibility, and reliability. The
                courier service providers give careful consideration to elements
                that raise service quality and guarantee the safety of the
                delivered parcel. When aiming to deliver a satisfying and
                enjoyable customer experience, service providers must prioritise
                interpersonal relationships alongside the reliability,
                assurance, responsiveness, and tangible aspects of their
                services. By doing so, they can enhance customer satisfaction,
                loyalty, and trust, which are vital to the industry’s long-term
                viability and sustainability.<br /><br />A gap analysis was
                conducted to identify and address existing issues, enabling
                service providers to enhance their business operations.
                Determining precisely how the consumers’ expectations and
                perceptions differ from one another is the most crucial step in
                the gap analysis process. The courier service provider uses
                these results to prioritise areas that require development.
                Taking care of these variables that have stronger negative
                associations may result in a more positive assessment or
                conclusion overall, most likely addressing client happiness,
                trust, or the perceived calibre of the service.<br /><br />Based
                on the IPA Matrix, results showed that there were seven (7)
                characteristics such as courier service provider provide
                adequate tracking and monitoring system; prompt response to
                customer request; ability in handling lost and damaged parcels;
                courier service is helpful in guiding customers to ensure parcel
                is delivered safely; courier service provider assure declaration
                of liability should the parcel is lost or damaged; consistence
                in meeting timeline; and controlled damage in service delivery
                that requires improvement by service providers. For instance, it
                demonstrates how these characteristics elevate customer
                expectation even in situations where the actual experience
                resulted at the low level. Therefore, the courier service
                providers must successfully satisfy customer expectations by
                increasing additional effort to enhance these aspects and pay
                close attention to them to guarantee that parcel safety
                compliances are met.<br /><br />The outcome indicates how
                significant several issues and challenges with parcel delivery
                services are thought to be. The outcome makes it evident that
                different consumers have different perspectives on and
                experiences with these issues and challenges. Therefore, it is
                recommended that service providers prioritise addressing and
                resolving the issues and challenges identified in this study,
                such as parcel loss, damage, wrong delivery, dishonest staff,
                poor customer service, restricted delivery alternatives, and
                trouble in rescheduling deliveries. To improve the industry’s
                overall service standards, operational efficacy, and
                reliability, the courier service providers should prioritise
                resolving the issues and challenges related to finding. If these
                issues and challenges are successfully resolved, customers may
                be able to access a more robust and dependable service.<br /><br />The
                effectiveness of a last-mile delivery has a big impact on a
                service provider’s profitability. Consequently, to ensure that
                consumers receive the best possible service, it is imperative
                for the service provider to be well-versed in last-mile delivery
                best practices. Delivering parcels from the carrier facility to
                the designated address is the responsibility of the last-mile
                delivery phase, which is the last link in the supply chain. An
                efficient last-mile delivery strategy can result in things being
                delivered more quickly and for less money. The best practices
                employed by the parcel delivery companies in the selected
                countries were detailed in the study’s findings. Therefore, the
                service provider should investigate various strategies that
                might apply inside their businesses to ensure industry
                competitiveness and customer satisfaction with parcel safety and
                high-quality services provided during last-mile delivery.<br />

                The study’s findings indicated that the courier services quality
                did not completely comply with the consumers’ expectations, and
                there is still room to improve service quality and reduce the
                negative gaps. Decision-makers can further use the results of
                the IPA matrix to effectively allocate limited resources giving
                special attention to the organisational weaknesses. In addition,
                about the issues and challenges, it is critical to address the
                detrimental effect on the consumer’s satisfaction. The courier
                service providers should give priority to making improvements to
                the issues and challenges highlighted in the study of deliveries
                to all places to lessen this problem.
