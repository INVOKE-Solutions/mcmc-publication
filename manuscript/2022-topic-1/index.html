                The massive deployment of advanced wireless networks is
                essential to support broadband connectivity, low-latency
                communication, and Internet of Things applications.
                Nevertheless, in the time of coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
                there is a massive amount of misinformation and uncertainty
                about the impact of the fifth-generation (5G) cellular network
                on human health. Fake news and misconceptions about 5G in
                Malaysia may spread fear and undermine public trust, potentially
                causing delays in 5G deployment. Understanding Malaysian public
                perceptions of 5G EMF health effects is crucial for network
                infrastructure and devices. We conducted a research study on
                Public Perception on Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Emissions from
                5G Radio Communication Infrastructure and Consumer Premise
                Equipment (CPE) in Malaysia with the project acronym EMFERCICE.
                The project aims to investigate the level of Malaysian public
                perception of 5G radiation emissions in Malaysia. The study
                looked into public understanding factors, including information
                source characteristics (media exposure) and health-risk
                characteristics, taking into account their perceptions of EMF
                emission from network infrastructure and consumer premise
                equipment. The study found that over half of the respondents
                (56.6 per cent) out of 410 total respondents were concerned
                about 5G, with the biggest concern being the potential health
                effects of 5G radiation (69.4 per cent). The majority of the
                respondents perceived low to moderate levels of 5G radiation
                exposure, which may be due to their trust in policies protecting
                them from 5G EMF radiation. Most respondents (77.1 per cent)
                believed that public policies provide protection from EMF
                exposure. However, respondents who perceived high 5G radiation
                exposure were likely to have health concerns about 5G. The study
                suggests several recommendations to strengthen public trust in
                5G emissions which include clear communication of safety
                standards, independent research and studies, independent safety
                audits, continuous monitoring of emissions, and independent
                safety audit, aiming to build a positive narrative around 5G
                technology and maximise the benefits.<br />

                The recent development of the fifth-generation (5G) network has
                led to widespread expectations that it will revolutionise mobile
                communications. With applications such as industrial automation,
                extended reality, and autonomous vehicles, 5G is expected to
                lead to substantial benefits globally, including an estimated
                contribution of up to USD 588 billion in global tax revenue from
                2020 to 2034 (GSMA, 2018).<br /><br />Among the pioneer
                countries of 5G, Korean mobile carriers began distributing the
                service in April 2019 (France Presse, 2019), and in less than
                three (3) months, more than a million users have joined the
                network (Chamberlain, 2019). Since then, other countries have
                also witnessed steady increases in the number of subscribers,
                leading experts to project that the 5G network would cover 55 to
                65 per cent of the world’s population by 2025 (Reichert,
                2019).<br /><br />As such, demand for the 5G network has been
                high; Malaysia has also begun to strategise for 5G deployment
                via the National Digital Network (JENDELA) plan. JENDELA has
                targeted reaching 100 Mbps speed through 5G service by 2025,
                which means Malaysia will be charted as part of the 55 to 65 per
                cent 5G coverage of the worldwide projection by 2025.<br /><br />In
                contrast to its apparent popularity, however, the new technology
                may not be welcomed by everyone. Some people appear to embrace
                this novel technology, whereas others dissent, as members of the
                public have perceived that exposure to electromagnetic (EM)
                waves from 5G network base stations poses potential health
                risks. The current deployment of 5G in many countries around the
                world has triggered heated debates and unsettledness in the
                general public (Broad, 2019b; Foster, 2019). Protests in Korea
                have delayed the construction of base stations (Jun, 2019), and
                anti-5G demonstrations have filled the streets in the United
                Kingdom (Hern, 2019) and Switzerland (Jones, 2020).<br />

                RFR is non-ionising radiation that involves waves with smaller
                energy that cannot ionise the cells, thus preventing severe
                impacts on the exposed cells. Nevertheless, the electromagnetic
                field (EMF) can cause the molecules to vibrate, leading to a
                possible heating effect on the exposed tissues, i.e., a thermal
                effect (Foster et. al., 2017). In this regard, regulatory
                authorities such as the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
                Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the Federal Communications
                Commission (FCC) quantify the maximum allowable radio frequency
                (RF) exposure to limit the temperature rise of the exposed
                tissues (ICNIRP, 2020). Regarding the non-thermal long-term
                exposure to 5G, there is a debate in the community about whether
                it has adverse health impacts. However, no adverse effects have
                been proven for exposure that is consistent with the regulatory
                limits. The 5G cellular network promised to deliver
                high-data-rate communications for an increasing number of users.
                This can be done through network densification, which means
                installing a massive number of base stations and small cells, as
                well as adopting millimetre-wave (mm-wave) frequency. This has
                led to concerns among the population about the potential health
                impacts of being exposed to 5G radiofrequency radiation (RFR)
                (Nyberg and Hardel, 2017). The impact is worrying because the
                arising doubts about 5G can delay the deployment of 5G in some
                countries, leading to unfavourable economic impacts, as reported
                by Jones (2020).<br /><br />Additionally, network densification
                causes the space between users and the closest cell to close,
                increasing the perceived negative effects on health. EMF
                emissions result from both the expansion of customer premises
                equipment and network infrastructure (CPE). Nearly any end-user
                device nowadays qualifies as CPE. Telephone handsets, channel
                service units or data service units, routers or wireless access
                point devices, broadband, Ethernet, or DSL modems, cable set-top
                boxes, adapters for network services, local area network (LAN),
                or wide area network (WAN) devices, are just a few examples of
                the various types of equipment that qualify as CPE. Mobile
                phones and routers are common CPEs that emit EMF that are
                included in this equipment. The deployment of CPE close to
                consumers may lead to perceived health problems among them.<br />

                The Use of 5G Beamforming Antennas to Minimise Exposure to
                RF-EMF
              </h1>

                In order to increase network capacity and efficiency while
                lowering electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure, beamforming
                antennas are a crucial piece of technology utilised in 5G base
                stations (Larsson et. al., 2014; Ojaroudi et. al., 2020; and
                Betta et. al., 2022). It is a method for concentrating and
                directing electromagnetic signals in a particular direction that
                is utilised in wireless communication systems, including 5G.
                Beamforming directs signal energy toward the target receiver
                rather than dispersing it evenly in all directions, increasing
                signal intensity, coverage, and capacity. Instead of
                broadcasting their wireless signals in all directions, 5G base
                stations can focus them on the targeted users by employing
                beamforming. This makes it possible to utilise the energy
                transmitted more effectively, which lowers the total power
                needed for communication. Reduced power also reduces the amount
                of EMF exposure in the vicinity. To focus on certain user
                devices, beamforming antennas can dynamically change the beam’s
                shape and direction. By precisely directing the signal to a
                specific device, the base station can ensure the highest
                possible signal quality while using less unnecessary
                transmission power. Additionally, 5G base stations have the
                capacity to create numerous beams at once, improving the spatial
                reuse of the available spectrum. This increases network
                efficiency and lowers overall power consumption by allowing
                several customers to be served concurrently in the same
                frequency range. Depending on the user’s position, movement, and
                communication needs, beamforming antennas can change the
                direction of their beams. By allowing for configurable coverage
                and capacity distribution, this flexibility makes it possible to
                retain the essential signal quality while minimising extraneous
                radiation in places where it is not required.<br /><br />Although
                the need for communication systems with extremely dependable
                links and good coverage is undeniable, one (1) of the worries
                people have about the adoption of 5G technology is related to
                the potential biological impacts and health implications caused
                by electromagnetic exposure (Betta et. al., 2020). According to
                research, the general public is adamant that 5G densification
                causes an unchecked and undesirable rise in human exposure
                levels (Chiaraviglio et. al., 2022). A correct evaluation of EMF
                exposure is crucial for these reasons.<br />

                Fake theories and hoaxes that are not supported by any
                scientific data may be the cause of the uncertainty surrounding
                5G. It’s possible that the telecommunications sector has
                experienced a misunderstanding of 5G operational principles
                before, as it did with earlier generations of communications,
                such as 4G. As always, misunderstandings about emerging
                technology could lead people to overestimate the dangers of 5G
                exposure to their health. There are various false beliefs about
                5G that relate the spread of COVID-19 pandemic to exposure to
                5G’s EMFs. The World Health Organization (WHO) coined the term
                “infodemic” to describe the widespread spread of false
                information about COVID-19, which can have detrimental effects
                on the population due to the enormous number of hoaxes (WHO,
                2020). In several nations, there have reportedly been a number
                of 5G tower sabotage incidents (BBC, 2020; Liverpool Echo,
                2020). Numerous individuals have pushed for a vote to limit the
                radiation from mobile communications technology on the other
                side of the globe, where it was claimed that thousands of people
                protested against 5G in Switzerland (Keystone, 2019a, 2019b).
                Given the alarmist assertions that frequently surface in the
                media, such as the one (1) that 5G “could kill you,” this
                outrage may not be unexpected (Broad, 2019). Even though they
                are frequently broadcast on networks that are known for
                encouraging fake news and “selectively reporting the most
                sensational claims and giving a few marginal opponents of
                wireless technology a conspicuous new forum,” such statements
                may cause fear and damage public trust (Broad, 2019). (Broad,
                2019).<br /><br />From the literature survey, to date, there
                have been some discussions and statements on the potential
                health risk of 5G; however, there has been no specific
                structured study on the perceptions among Malaysians regarding
                the matter at hand. The proposed project aims to look into the
                level of Malaysian public perception of 5G radiation emissions
                in selected pioneer regions in Malaysia with 5G infrastructure.
                The study will look into the public understanding factor, which
                includes information source characteristics (media exposure) as
                well as health-risk characteristics that take into account their
                perceptions of EMF emission from network infrastructure and

                A nationwide study in Korea, reported in 2020, on factors
                affecting risk perception of electromagnetic waves from 5G
                network base stations (Koh et. al., 2020), found that EM waves
                from 5G network base stations were perceived as moderate health
                risks; the magnitude of the perceived risk was similar to that
                of EM waves from mobile phones, greater than that of household
                chemical products, but less than that of cigarette smoking. Some
                aspects of the study could be replicated in Malaysia.<br /><br />There
                have been several studies conducted to investigate the public’s
                perception of 5G radiation. One (1) such study was conducted by
                the Pew Research Center in the United States in February 2020,
                which surveyed over 10,000 Americans to gauge their views on 5G
                technology. The study found that while a majority of Americans
                (64 per cent) had heard about 5G technology, only 24 per cent
                understood it well, and 34 per cent had no opinion about the
                potential health effects of 5G technology. Another study was
                conducted in the UK by the research consultancy firm Ipsos MORI
                in December 2019, which surveyed over 2,200 UK adults to assess
                their attitudes towards 5G technology. The study found that 44
                per cent of respondents were concerned about the potential
                health risks of 5G radiation, while 36 per cent were worried
                about the impact on the environment.<br /><br />In France, a
                study conducted by the Harris Interactive research firm in
                November 2019 surveyed over 1,000 French people to assess their
                attitudes towards 5G technology. The aim of the study was to
                assess public attitudes towards 5G technology and the potential
                risks associated with its deployment. The study found that over
                half of the respondents (52 per cent) were concerned about the
                potential health effects of 5G radiation, while 58 per cent were
                worried about the environmental impact of 5G technology.
                Interestingly, the study also found that younger people were
                more likely to be concerned about 5G radiation than older
                people, with 59 per cent of respondents aged 18 to 34 expressing
                concern compared to 46 per cent of those aged 55 and over. The
                studies also suggest that while many French are aware of 5G
                technology and its potential benefits, there are concerns about
                the potential health and environmental risks associated with its
                deployment.<br /><br />Overall, these studies suggest that while
                a significant portion of the public is aware of 5G technology,
                many people have concerns about its potential health and
                environmental impacts.<br />

                Malaysia. The survey was open to all states in Malaysia,
                providing a better sampling from the Malaysian perspective. Data
                collection involved self-administered questionnaires distributed

                Respondents were asked if they have concerns generally about 5G,
                and the findings show that 56.6 per cent (n = 232) agree that
                they have concerns about 5G, and 43.4 per cent (n = 178) of the
                respondents do not have any concerns about 5G. The results may
                suggest mixed reactions to 5G, as more than half of the
                respondents are comfortable with the new generation of
                communications networks. However, 43.4 per cent of the
                respondents may be significant to show that there are concerns
                around 5G among the Malaysian public.<br /><br />The
                distribution of concerns regarding 5G is tabulated in Table 2.
                Table 1 shows the highest concerns about 5G were the health
                concerns about 5G radiation (69.4 per cent), followed by the
                cost that will be too expensive (41.5 per cent), the effect on
                the environment (37.5 per cent), and the stability of the
                connections (31.0 per cent). The findings were similar to the
                research conducted in France by the Harris Interactive research
                firm in November 2019, where it was reported that over half of
                the French respondents (52 per cent) were concerned about the
                potential health effects of 5G radiation, while 58 per cent were
                worried about the environmental impact of 5G technology. This is
                also found in the UK; in a study conducted by the research
                consultancy firm Ipsos MORI in December 2019, 44 per cent of
                respondents were concerned about the potential health risks of
                5G radiation, while 36 per cent were worried about the impact on
                the environment. Our findings exhibit that Malaysians’ concern
                is much higher for health risks, and interestingly, cost has
                become the second biggest concern other than the environment.<br />

                The results revealed that the majority of the respondents (32.4
                per cent, n = 133) perceived that the level of 5G radiation
                exposure is low, 29.5 per cent (n = 121) perceived that they
                were exposed to moderate 5G radiation, and 21.7 per cent (n =
                89) perceived that they were exposed to a high level of 5G
                radiation. 16.3 per cent (n = 16.3) of the respondents perceived
                that they were not exposed to 5G radiation. However, relating
                the perceived radiation exposure to the 172 respondents who have
                health concerns about 5G radiation, the majority of them (41.3
                per cent) (n = 71) perceived a high level of 5G radiation
                exposure, 39.5 per cent (n = 68) moderate exposure, 16.3 per

                The survey results show that 100 per cent of our respondents are
                mobile phone users, and the majority of them (72.4 per cent, n =
                297) are microwave oven users. Meanwhile, only 31.5 per cent (n
                = 129) are smartwatch users. This data potentially shows that
                the respondents are familiar with other sources of
                electromagnetic wave radiation, such as microwave ovens and
                Bluetooth (smart devices). However, almost half of the
                respondents (46.3 per cent) charge their mobile phones nearby
                when asleep. This indicates the attitude toward handling devices
                with electromagnetic emissions in a less safe environment.<br /><br />Respondents
                were also asked about mobile applications that they usually used
                and how much time they spent on these applications every day.
                According to Figure 1, social media applications (87.6 per cent,
                n = 359) are the top usual applications used on mobile phones,
                followed by video streaming (75.8 per cent, n = 315), voice
                calls using WhatsApp (72 per cent, n = 295), video-based social
                media (46.8 per cent, n = 192), and online video games (29.3 per
                cent, n = 120). The respondents mostly spend less than two (2)
                hours per day on social media, video streaming, and voice calls
                using WhatsApp. Video-based social media and online video games
                are less used by the respondents, and hence less time is spent
                on these applications. However, for each application,
                respondents spent more than four (4) hours daily, especially for
                video streaming applications like YouTube. Theoretically, this
                may contribute to a higher level of EMF exposure for the
                users.<br />

                Table 2 shows a total of 18.3 per cent of respondents strongly
                agreed that 5G EMF radiation can cause headaches, cancer (17.1
                per cent), harm the foetus during pregnancy (15.9 per cent), and
                impact fertility (14.6 per cent). On the other hand, more than
                half of the respondents (54.4 per cent) strongly disagree that
                vaccines contain 5G microchips. This is one (1) of the famous
                fake theories about 5G during the COVID-19 pandemic. From the
                table, it can be concluded that approximately 30 per cent of the
                population believes (from somewhat agreeing to strongly
                agreeing) that the fake theory regarding COVID-19 vaccines
                contains 5G microchips, this may be worth of an issue to be
                tackled to build public trust on vaccines.<br /><br />Meanwhile,
                Table 3 shows the analysis of perceived health risks obtained in
                Table 2 in terms of the degree and severity of the perceived
                risks. Table 3 demonstrates that based on the mean risk score,
                the perceived health-related risk is at a moderate level
                (overall mean score of 2.64 and standard deviation of 1.34).
                These results provide insight into the degree of public
                perception of the health-related risk of 5G EMF radiation. Our
                study found that EM waves from 5G network base stations were
                perceived as moderate health risks. We hypothesised that the
                attitude of placing a mobile phone charger nearby while asleep
                would be associated with lower health-related risk perception as
                the behaviour is suggestive of indifference to exposure to EM
                waves; however, no significant relationship was observed as
                well.<br />

                According to Karlsen and Aalberg (2021), people go to social
                media to get their daily news updates. Findings show that the
                highest media used among Malaysian youths was YouTube (75.9 per
                cent), followed by Facebook (67.8 per cent), websites (64.6 per
                cent), and Instagram (59.8 per cent). Meanwhile, the least
                popular media platform was Reddit (0.5 per cent). According to
                the Digital Business Lab (2022), YouTube has the highest
                penetration compared to other social media platforms in
                Malaysia. Approximately half of Malaysian youths spend their
                time on YouTube. The study concluded that users are comfortable
                maintaining a presence across several media platforms.<br />

                Based on the findings, Table 4 shows that 60 per cent of the
                respondents browsed the website to get information on 5G. It is
                worth noting that the majority of the respondents stated that
                they read news about 5G on websites. Additionally, 43.4 per cent
                of the respondents always watched Facebook, and 35.4 per cent
                often watched about 5G on television. The results also
                demonstrated that respondents used friends to get information on
                5G (30.2 per cent). This finding was useful enough to understand
                that these users would use several channels to sustain their
                knowledge of 5G. Using a variety of sources can lead to more
                in-depth information. In Table 5, 58.8 per cent of the
                respondents said that local and international sources are the
                most trusted.<br />

                regarding 5G EMF emissions is accurate. Yet, the findings of

                disagree that the information reported in the media regarding 5G
                EMF emissions is easy to understand. This implies that the

                Past studies on the association between objective knowledge and
                risk perception have shown mixed results. In our study,
                respondents who scored above the mean on objective knowledge
                considered EM waves from 5G network base stations as risky as
                those who scored below the mean. When it comes to perceived
                health-related risk, it is interesting to note that there is no
                difference between the respondents of high objective knowledge
                and low objective knowledge on 5G emission since the mean risk
                score for both groups is similar.<br />

                The highest percentage of 43.9 per cent (n = 180) for perceived
                knowledge regarding potential health effects due to exposure to
                EMF radiation from 5G network base stations is for scale 3
                (somewhat agree). From the summation of respondents on a scale
                of 3-5, it can be deduced that a total of 78.3 per cent believe
                that they are knowledgeable in this aspect. This may correlate
                to the fact that the majority of the population (almost 60 per
                cent) possess a high level of objective knowledge of 5G
                emissions. Research findings show that 76.6 per cent of the
                respondents agree (scale 3-5) that they know that there are
                public policies or guidelines that provide protection from EMF
                exposure. This demonstrates that the policymakers (i.e.,
                Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission MCMC)) have
                made good progress in informing the general public regarding the
                policies developed. This is further supported by 77.1 per cent
                of the respondents agreeing (on a scale of 3-5) that public
                policies provide protection from EMF exposure. Meanwhile, 79.8
                per cent of the respondents agree (on a scale of 3-5) that the
                EMF radiation from the 5G base station and equipment is within
                the allowed range. This is a considerably high degree of public
                trust towards the policies, despite the concerns the public has
                about the health-related risk of 5G EMF emissions. However,
                around 20 to 23 per cent of respondents did not trust the
                policies developed to provide protection from EMF exposure,
                making it worthwhile for the research to recommend improvements
                to further build public trust in these policies and
                guidelines.<br /><br />It is good to see from the results that
                the respondents agree that the public policies provide
                protection from EMF exposure and that the EMF radiation from the
                5G base station and equipment is within the allowed range.<br />

                education, awareness, information, and enforcement of 5G EMF
                emissions. Respondents suggested that more awareness programmes
                be available to educate the public on the safety aspects of 5G

                Ensuring clear communication of safety standards and regulations
                related to 5G emissions is crucial. Our studies reported that
                the majority of the respondents agreed that they knew that there
                were public policies or guidelines that provided protection from
                EMF exposure and believed that the public policies did provide
                protection for them. Even though 79.8 per cent of Malaysians
                believe that the EMF radiation from 5G base stations and
                equipment is within the allowed range (79.8 per cent), there are
                around 23 per cent of respondents who strongly disagree with the
                majority and do not trust the policies developed to provide
                protection from EMF exposure. This data should not go unnoticed.
                For continuous quality improvement, regulatory bodies such as
                MCMC can provide accessible and easy-to-understand information
                about the established safety standards and how they are
                enforced. This can help alleviate any concerns by assuring the
                public that 5G networks operate within safe limits.

                Supporting and conducting independent research and studies on
                the health and safety aspects of 5G emissions can help address
                concerns and provide scientific evidence. Governments such as
                the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Health,
                together with other relevant organisations, can allocate
                resources to fund reputable research institutions to conduct
                comprehensive studies on the potential health effects of 5G
                emissions. The findings from these studies can be shared with
                the public to demonstrate transparency and evidence-based
                decision-making.
                <br /><br />
                This has also been practised in the United States, where the
                National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocated specific funding
                to support research on the potential health effects of 5G
                emissions. For example, the National Institute of Environmental
                Health Sciences (NIEHS), one (1) of the institutes under the
                NIH, has funded studies to investigate the biological effects of
                radiofrequency radiation, including those associated with 5G
                technology. These studies aim to provide valuable insights into
                the potential health implications of 5G and contribute to the
                scientific understanding of radiofrequency radiation’s effects
                on human health.

                Australia has developed a dedicated national centre for
                electromagnetic radiation studies. The Australian Centre for
                Electromagnetic Bioeffects Research (ACEBR) is a collaborative
                research initiative that brings together leading Australian
                research institutions and government agencies. ACEBR conducts
                research on the health effects of electromagnetic radiation,
                including research related to 5G technology. The centre receives
                funding from various sources, including the Australian
                government and industry partners, to support its research
                activities. Their studies focus on understanding the biological
                effects of electromagnetic radiation and providing
                evidence-based insights into the potential health impacts of 5G
                technology.

                A similar multi-institutional concerted effort can be done in
                Malaysia to address the concerns from the Malaysian public. Our
                research findings show that Malaysians put their trust more in
                international media reporting on 5G emissions compared to local
                media. The role of scientific studies done by Malaysian experts
                in an organised fashion may contribute to increasing public
                trust in the safety of 5G emissions.<br />

                The results of these audits can be made publicly available to
                demonstrate adherence to safety guidelines. There are no
                publicly available audit reports available yet; this

                The majority of the respondents in our study perceived low to
                moderate levels of 5G radiation exposure. However, respondents
                who perceived high 5G radiation exposure are likely to have
                health concerns about 5G. EM waves from 5G network base stations
                were perceived as moderate health risks. Hence, implementing
                continuous monitoring of 5G emissions can provide real-time data
                on radiation levels and ensure compliance with safety limits.
                MCMC and network operators can establish monitoring systems and
                publicly share the collected data. This transparency can help
                address concerns and show a commitment to maintaining safe
                radiation levels.

                Launching targeted public awareness campaigns can help educate
                the public about the safety measures in place and address any
                misconceptions. These campaigns can provide accurate information
                about 5G emissions, debunk myths, and highlight the rigorous
                safety protocols followed during the deployment of 5G networks.
                Collaborating with health professionals, experts, and community
                leaders can enhance the credibility and reach of these
                campaigns. <br /><br />As an example, the 5GRIT programme in the
                UK aims to address the connectivity challenges faced by rural
                communities and demonstrate the benefits of 5G technology in
                these areas. The programme involves testing and trials of 5G
                solutions in rural locations, engaging with local communities,
                and providing accurate information about the technology. By
                showcasing the positive impact of 5G in rural areas, the
                programme helps to address concerns and build public trust.<br /><br />Malaysians
                would use several channels to sustain their knowledge of 5G.
                Using a variety of sources can lead to more in-depth
                information. Our research findings show that the Malaysian
                public prefers YouTube, which is at the top of the list of
                most-used media. Meanwhile, websites and Facebook are the top
                sources for information on 5G, while YouTube is at the bottom of
                the list. To improve the dissemination strategy, it is
                recommended that MCMC and other agencies like the Ministry of
                Health leverage YouTube as a platform for multimedia content to
                educate and create awareness on safety measures and thus provide

                Organising public demonstrations and showcases is another
                effective way to manage perception. These events allow people to
                experience the benefits and potential applications of 5G

                high-speed downloads, augmented reality, virtual reality, and
                IoT applications. By providing interactive experiences, these
                events help alleviate concerns and generate positive interest in
                5G. MCMC has organised use case demonstrations at several places
                in the country and published “5G MALAYSIA DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS
                FACTSHEET’ in 2019. This effort is commendable. The
                demonstrations should be supported more with the involvement of
                various parties and are recommended to be continuously done and
                open to the public at large. This recommendation may act to
                balance benefits over concerns about the health risk of 5G EMF
                emissions.<br /><br />It is hoped that these recommendations
                will help to build a positive narrative around 5G technology,
                promote responsible deployment, and maximise the benefits of
                this technology while minimising any potential risks.<br />

                Our study concluded that the degree of perceived health-related
                risk is “moderate” among the Malaysian public, with many
                variables being studied as contributing factors. All the

                education institutions, and telecommunication providers, to
                strengthen public trust towards 5G EMF emission and 5G
                technology in general. It is hoped that the results of our study
                will be reflected in the construction of an appropriate risk
                communication strategy in order to allow for a good spread of 5G
                technologies. It is also hoped that this pioneering research
                will spur more research on 5G EMF emissions, particularly
                technical research on the health effects and level of exposure
                that the Malaysian public is experiencing.
