                The research aims to understand how data-sharing affects
                employee productivity and decision-making using a qualitative
                Malaysian Administrative Modernisation and Management
                PlanningUnit (MAMPU) case study. The finding shows that MAMPU
                developed two (2) data-sharing portals; one (1) is for open
                data-sharing, and the other is for internal and restricted data
                or Malaysian Government Central Data Exchange (MyGDX) that links
                data-sharing from various agencies in the public sector. The
                research found that data-sharing could potentially influence
                employee productivity and performance as data are valuable
                resources that could help employees effectively perform their
                jobs. This research also found that the absence of data-sharing
                can restrict the efficiency and effectiveness of the employees
                in acting fast and taking action to improve and enhance their
                operations and responsibilities. The finding also shows that
                data-sharing, especially internal data-sharing, consists of much
                critical and impactful data that are not mostly and openly
                shared. Thus, relying only on open data without internal data
                will affect the effectiveness and completeness of
                decision-making. Quality data is highly critical as low-quality
                data will cause ineffective decision-making quality. Therefore,
                more quality decision making requires open and essential data
                from internal data-sharing as it may have more valuable data
                critical for sound decision-making. In addition, the result
                found that employee skills and analytical capabilities are more
                important than just having sophisticated and/or automated tools,
                as without human capabilities and skills, the effectiveness of
                data-sharing and the quality of the data shared maybe affected.
                However, both sophisticated and/or automated tools are very
                useful for affecting decision-making quality and work
                effectiveness. The research also highlights the importance of
                data-sharing practices in driving innovations, as many
                data-driven opportunities can be made possible with data
                sharing.<br />

                Today’s business environment is characterised by fierce
                competition, technological advancement, and the big data
                revolution; organisations need to act fast and utilise the
                resources efficiently and effectively to capitalise on the
                opportunity and make effective decisions fundamental for the
                organisation’s survival and sustainable performance (Klus &amp;
                Müller, 2021). In the era of big data eruption, digital and
                information technology have become the nexus of the industrial
                revolution; thus, organisations need to invest, adapt, and
                respond to this quickly and accurately to capture market share
                (Ghobakhloo &amp; Fathi, 2019). Big data explosion creates
                voluminous data-sharing, which is pivotal for an organisation’s
                success. Unsurprisingly, data-sharing has become the building
                block of the big data revolution. Studies have found that
                data-sharing has caused a significant impact on the operation
                and quality of the business in terms of improved services,
                enhanced organisation performance, increased innovation, and
                quality of decision-making (e.g., Santoroet al., 2019;
                Chatterjee et al., 2021), it also advances research and benefits
                society (Darch &amp; Knox, 2017). The lack of data-sharing and
                big data analytics capabilities can hinder the significant
                effect of accurate predictive values (Dubey et al., 2019), thus
                hampering the decision-making quality and directly reducing the
                organisations’ performance and competitive advantage, innovation
                as well as employee productivity.<br /><br />Although
                data-sharing is fundamental for organisational success and
                crucial for advancing the big data industry (Janssenet al.,
                2017), not many organisations are willing to share data openly
                (Welch etal., 2016; Santoro et al., 2019). Some share only
                certain data and only for internal use (Ghasemaghaei, 2019).
                Researchers pointed out that organisations are reluctant
                primarily due to various reasons, such as lack of trust due to
                no sophisticated tools to deal with privacy data management,
                property rights, and intelligence data, as well as lack of big
                data analytics capability, causing organisations to be careful
                with open data-sharing (Wimmer et al., 2016). While most
                organisations (public and private) understand the crucial role
                of data-sharing in improving their predictive values of
                decision-making accuracy, which is important for performance
                effectiveness, many are still prudent and insecure but just
                satisfied with sharing data internally between departments
                within the organisations. Some may share data with direct
                collaborators and important partners to improve their business
                operations but are restricted to the area directly dealing with
                the collaboration work. This creates a loop about whether
                internal data-sharing has the same effects as open data-sharing
                regarding the predictive value of decision-making on
                organisation and employee effectiveness. Studies on open
                data-sharing have exhibited the positive impacts of data-sharing
                on decision-making quality, innovation, performance, and
                competitive advantage (Bedini et al., 2014); however, there was
                a lack of studies on the effect of internal data-sharing on
                similar outcomes. <br />

                Among the leading impacts of data-sharing is its effectiveness
                in bringing positive outcomes and profit to organisations
                (Mohamed Ali, 2021), leading to increased performance. Thus,
                organisations cannot ignore the significant role of performance
                in its survival and effectiveness as to date, with the highly
                competitive business environment and digitalised economy, there
                is a growing pressure that compels organisations to utilise big
                data analytics to achieve competitive advantage and gain the
                market share (Wang, 2018). With the current phenomenon,
                organisations cannot just rely on traditional performance
                achievement but need to increase innovation and possess
                analytical capability aligned with the recent technological
                development of big data and a digitalised economy to achieve
                better and more sustainable performance. <br />

                Undoubtedly that the quality of the decision-making determines
                the success of the organisation’s overall performance
                (Ghasemaghaei etal., 2018). Big data through data-sharing helps
                organisations, managers, and employees create values that
                contribute to quality decision-making. Many organisations have
                started to believe they would incur a loss if they do not use
                big data analytics to get accurate data for business decisions
                and capture this vast market share (Chatterjee et al., 2021).
                Using big data analytics could improve real-time decision-making
                and contribute to overall employee and organisational
                performance (Loukis et al., 2019). In the public sector, for
                example, data also plays an important role in making
                better-informed decisions across public sectors, contributing to
                sound policymaking (Mohamed Ali, 2021).<br />

                Data-sharing refers to the disposition or preservation of data
                for public access with the purpose of providing access for reuse
                (Chawinga &amp; Zinn,2019). It is also called open data or a
                deliberate effort to make raw data fully available for public
                access (Dong &amp; Li, 2017; Chawinga &amp; Zinn, 2019).
                Data-sharing facilitates research and transferring into values
                through data reuse, making data interoperable (Logan, 2021).
                Data-sharing differs slightly from knowledge-sharing or
                information-sharing as both typically refer to the exchange or
                sharing of knowledge or information among employees in the
                organisations they acquired or created (Gibbert &amp;Krause,
                2002; Rutten et al., 2016). Hogel, Partboteeah, and Munson
                (2003) define knowledge sharing as the exchange of experience,
                information, skills, tacit information, and explicit information
                among employees. Other studies, such as Wiewiora, Trigunasyah,
                Murphy and Coffey (2013), define knowledge sharing as expert
                insights, while Wagner (2008) defines it as the act of making
                knowledge available to others (either within the firms or
                outside the firms). Similarly, as defined by Xiao, Zhang and
                Basadur (2016), information sharing refers to members
                (employees) delivering information to each other. Therefore,
                what makes data-sharing different from information-sharing or
                knowledge-sharing is that data-sharing is more comprehensive and
                includes raw data, primary or secondary data, facts, knowledge,
                evidence, and experience. It goes beyond the academic world
                (Hulsen, 2020). Therefore, it can be understood that knowledge
                sharing, and information sharing are part of data sharing.<br /><br />In
                Malaysia, most private sector organisations focus on internal
                data-sharing to improve their systems, enabling data-sharing
                between departments before sharing the data with other
                organisations (Malaysian National Data-sharing Policy, 2019).
                Although open data-sharing has a huge potential, many are
                concerned about the protection of the marketshare, the cost and
                benefit of data-sharing, the ambiguity of data-sharing that
                could violate personal rights and the development of a
                sustainable data-sharing model. Some prefer internal
                data-sharing for following ISO/IEC 27000 (international
                organisation for standardisation in terms of data security)
                which ensures the security of customers’ and partners’ personal
                data. It is very important for organisations to also classify
                their data-sharing into open data and/or confidential/private to
                ensure data security. Following ISO/IEC 27000 will protect the
                data and thus make it safe to be shared openly (Mohamed Ali,
                2021).<br />

                Data classification allows the storage and processing of the
                data into categories (Saravanan &amp; Sujatha, 2018). This will
                increase the organisation’s data security/data protection. Data
                classification can also help the organisation conform to their
                internal data protection in accordance with ISO/IEC 27000 of
                data security. Studies (e.g., Tankard,2015; Kitsios et al.,
                2023) have indicated that data classification could enhance
                data-sharing security, thus improving the organisations’
                data-sharing policy. <br />

                Data automation refers to creating data entities and data
                objects that can be used to automate data operations and data
                modelling, enabling businesses to confidently handle data more
                efficiently and consistently (Duan et al., 2015), thus improving
                quality data critical for effective decision-making. With data
                automation, employees can develop processes quickly while still
                ensuring accuracy and compliance with regulations. This helps
                organisations make the most of their data and make data-driven
                decisions faster and easier than ever before. Data automation
                can process large data sets accurately and efficiently (Wuet
                al., 2013) involving internal data such as internal
                communications, job posting management, or open data such as
                external company reviews. Thus, to ensure an organisation
                becomes more effective and increases its predictive
                decision-making analytics, automated data tools are required to
                provide timely data updates and more accurate data using actual

                organisation (i.e. Malaysian Administrative Modernisation and
                Management Planning Unit (MAMPU)). The data analysis involves
                reviews of the organisation’s written reports
                (internal/external) and expert interviews with data experts and
                policymakers involved in data-sharing policies and
                decision-making.<br /><br />This study focuses on MAMPU as the
                research subject. After reviewing the background of MAMPU, it is
                noted that MAMPU is involved in data-sharing. MAMPU acts as the
                central agency or enabler that provides a platform that links
                the data from the participating agencies and shares them openly
                on data.gov.my and/or through the Malaysian Government Central
                Data Exchange (MyGDX) for internal data-sharing and/or
                restricted data-sharing. In this study, a purposive sampling
                method was employed in the selection of the
                experts/interviewees. The sampling method chooses the sample

                This study uses two (2) methods/instruments to collect the data
                (i.e.,written report reviews and analysis and expert
                interviews). First, this study reviews and analyses the written
                report published by MAMPU regarding its data-sharing. This is
                followed by four (4) expert interviews with the data experts and
                policymakers to gather more and deeper information regarding
                data-sharing practices at MAMPU. The written reports were
                analysed using NVivo automated text software version 12.0. For
                the expert interviews, each of the interviews was audio-taped or
                voice-recorded to ease the data transcription into a Word
                document as it allowed us to record accurately what was said
                compared to notes taking. The interview questions were based on
                the research objectives. Thus, the findings from each of the
                four (4) interviews were summarised according to the research
                objectives.<br />

                The NVivo automated text analysis results based on the written
                reports shows that MAMPU is involved in government open
                data-sharing, where MAMPU links data from government agencies to
                an open data platform called data.gov.my. MAMPU is also involved
                in internal data-sharing through MyGDX portal for a more
                restricted/internal data-sharing, which is shared through the
                Application Programming Interface (API)upon request from the
                data users and must be approved by the data owners. In general,
                the result indicates the importance of open and internal
                data-sharing in the government agenda. Figure 1 displays the
                word cloud result from NVivo analysis.<br />

                The results of the interview with MAMPU’s data experts and
                policymakers about the effectiveness of data-sharing practices
                on employee performance/productivity show a mixed outcome. This
                is mainly because MAMPU, as a central agency, acts to link data
                from agencies into an open data-sharing portal (i.e. data.gov)
                and for internally restricted data on MyGDX. MAMPU does not
                collect data directly from the data owners/sources. Therefore,
                MAMPU does not have the actual statistics to confirm that
                data-sharing has a significant positive impact on employee
                workout comes (i.e. performance/productivity). For instance, the
                data expert states that:<br />
              </div>
              <div
                id="text_block-1390-164"

              >
                “If we talk about the impact of data-sharing, I don’t see it.
                It’s not that I don’t see it. I think that MyGDX is less
                relevant because we provide a platform for them. The person who
                is using the data-sharing from MyGDX or the person who obtains
                the data is someone else. For example, at MAMPU, this is another
                part that, like us, has a system that we have created. In making
                that decision, they use the MyGDX platform. But the impact of
                the data-sharing whether it is good or bad, must be evaluated by
                the agencies or data users. But if I must respond about the
                impact, it is only based on what we are expected, not on what we
                have experienced. The impact of data usage after that, that’s
                what we don’t know”.<br />
              </div>
              <div
                id="text_block-1392-164"

              >
                However, according to other experts, sharing data among
                employees can positively impact on their performance and
                productivity. Data sharing can make their jobs easier by
                increasing work effectiveness. The data helps employees solve
                problems, reduce errors, and enhance the quality of their work,
                leading to high-value outcomes.<br /><br />In this case, the
                expert indicates the importance of internal data sharing
                regarding the database by referring to the case involving
                Bantuan Rakyat 1 Malaysian (BR1M), Bantuan Perihatin or e-kasih
                under the Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia (LHDN). For
                example, all data regarding the receivers of BRIM, Bantuan
                Perihatin and e-kasih in the system in LHDN are collected
                internally and not directly from the public. For example, LHDN
                collects the data from the Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara (JPN) and
                other agencies and decides the receivers’ suitability before
                LHDN channels the funds to them. Some verifications,
                validations, and data updates from the data owners/sources were
                performed later and from time to time to improve the service.
                This example shows that internal data-sharing could affect
                performance/productivity positively. In addition, the
                data-sharing portal developed by MAMPU links data from various
                agencies on one (1) platform as in open data (data.gov) and
                restricted/internal as in MyGDX, which provide data that are
                accurate, reliable, and highly operability thus help the
                agencies or employees, including the policymakers to perform
                their tasks and responsibilities more accurately, with minimum
                errors, thus helping employees to achieve better performance and
                increase productivity.<br />

                especially for policymakers, relies heavily on the accuracy and
                quality of data collected. The decision-making process and
                policy outcomes will suffer if the data is inaccurate or of low
                quality. To mitigate this, policymakers take the initiative to
                gather accurate information by visiting relevant agencies to
                better understand of the issue and learn from past experiences.
                Seeking advice and guidance from the Chief Government Security
                Officer (CGSO) or legal advisers also helps policymakers gain
                comprehensive knowledge before developing policies. According to
                one(1) of the policymakers:<br />

                “Data-sharing will make the decision more informed, more
                accurate, more real-time. It doesn’t matter if the data is
                internal or open”.<br />

                Version 2.0 of the government’s open data-sharing developed by
                MAMPU added a data dashboard and data catalogue which is
                considered useful for decision-makers as a reference prior to
                in-depth investigation.Thorough checking of data-sharing from
                MyGDX can also further enhance decision-making quality.
                <br /><br />The policymaker in this study also believes that
                accurate and realtime data-sharing between government agencies
                could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of many important
                decisions. For example, the recent increase in prices of
                commodities like fish, chicken, and local rice could have been
                avoided if the Kementerian Perdagangan Dalam Negeri, Koperasi
                dan Kepenggunaan (KPDNKK) had shared and monitored their data to
                predict the sudden price rise caused by shortages. With the help
                of reliable data-sharing, the Minister or top management could
                make fast and accurate decisions to direct agencies under the
                Kementerian Pertanian dan Keterjaminan Makanan Malaysia(KPKMM),
                such as the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), to issue
                more licences for chicken breeding and farming, request the
                FederalAgricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) to monitor rice
                production, and the Lembaga Perikanan Malaysia (LKM) to supply
                more fish. By sharing data between all agencies, the Kementerian
                Perdagangan Dalam Negeri(KPDN) could predict and forecast
                shortages and surpluses of essential food supplies, and order
                relevant agencies to increase and monitor the supply, thus
                preventing shortages and stabilising prices. This could also
                help avoid conflicting statements from different agencies
                regarding shortages, surpluses, and the prices of supplies.<br />

                All the experts interviewed acknowledge the critical importance
                of having comprehensive and voluminous data-sharing to determine
                the quality of the data collected. The policymakers believed
                that data quality could be determined based on
                comprehensive/voluminous data-sharing. Without voluminous
                data-sharing, policymakers may find it difficult to determine
                the quality of the data gathered from the data-sharing.
                According to one (1) of the experts, both voluminous and
                high-quality data are very important as they will have a high
                impact. This kind of data could cover a variety of aspects, and
                the analysis will also show accurate and comprehensive coverage
                that is useful to many people and organisations. The data expert
                states that:<br />
              </div>
              <div
                id="text_block-1414-164"

              >
                “The volume of data and the data quality will indeed have a high
                effect. Because many data are usually related to high coverage.
                We can cover or even our analysis can cover as many individuals
                as possible”.<br />

              >
                However, the expert also warned that highly voluminous data may
                include irrelevant data which can create noise in the
                decision-making. This noise will distract the policymakers
                and/or decision-makers from focusing on the real cause of the
                main issue to solve, this may affect the decision/policymaking
                efficiency and effectiveness.<br /><br />The MAMPU has developed
                two (2) data-sharing portals, namely data.gov.my and MyGDX, that
                enable data-sharing from various agencies on a single platform
                for open data and for restricted data. However, it is the
                complete responsibility of the data suppliers/providers (i.e.
                agencies) to ensure the quality of the data they provide. As the
                agencies collect data from sources (or data owners), they must
                ensure the accuracy and the integrity of the data. The agencies
                conduct several verifications before data warehousing and
                data-sharing. Especially for restricted data-sharing in MyGDX,
                the data is encrypted as it is confidential and restricted.
                Thus, only the data users who receive approval from the data
                owners or the data suppliers will be given an API to access that
                data. Even for open data, it is highly important to have high
                data quality, especially in an open data portal (data.gov.my).
                The portal provides the data dashboards/data visualisation and
                data catalogue, which need high-quality data to provide accurate
                and useful dashboards. The open data-sharing portal version 2.0
                provides high frequency, high granularity and high impact data,
                resulting daily views of more than 20, 000. Thus, it is highly
                essential to have high-quality data.<br />

                Based on the interview outputs, data-sharing involves many
                automated tools to improve its quality. Most of the agencies,
                especially those that share data via MyGDX, use tools for their
                data-sharing. Even without specific tools, the agencies share
                data using API technology, and use the Secure File Transfer
                Protocol (SFTP), which is a network protocol for securely
                accessing, transferring and managing large files and sensitive
                data. As the data expert states that:<br />
              </div>

              >
                “Through, SFTP, the agencies transfer files in CSV or an Excel
                form from one (1) server to another or manually. There are those
                who upgrade it to make server scheduling for data transfer”<br />

                Raw data or data from original sources often contain mixed
                categories of information that may be useful, but also
                confidential and private. Due to the Personal Data Protection
                Act (PDPA) and the requirements of the CGSO, agencies are not
                allowed to share data without first classifying it according to
                the relevant categories. Data classification is essential for
                sharing data and for data visualisation or analytics. The
                classification process should be done by the agencies themselves
                as they have a better understanding of their data and can ensure
                that the classification is done accurately. According to the
                data expert:<br />

                “Once the data is confidential, it cannot be shared, that is one
                thing. At MAMPU, for example, the data shared through MyGDX are
                usually data other than open data. When there is other than open
                data, such as limited, confidential, secret, or top secret.
                These four (4) classifications of data are limited and
                confidential, and there is another one (1) in terms of MyGDX is
                personal data. Personal data should fall under CONFIDENTIAL.
                Following the data governance, the agencies will look at every

                According to the experts interviewed, analytical skills are
                crucial for employees as tools alone cannot compensate for human
                skills. Employees with strong analytical skills not only perform
                their jobs effectively but also help organisations save costs,
                as they can replace the need for expensive tools. The data
                expert interviewed emphasised the importance of analytical
                skills for employees, as they are essential for maximising the
                use of sophisticated tools. The expert also agrees that
                sophisticated/automated tools are useful for policymaking, if
                the development of that policy requires voluminous or
                comprehensive data; thus, the ability or analytical skills to
                use the software and analyse the data are crucial to own.
                However, the data quality does not depend on the
                ability/analytical skills of the employees. The quality of the
                data must be guaranteed and verified from the start of data
                creation. Thus, this policymaker asserts that high-quality data
                are the data that are correct, valid, and unquestionable. Thus,
                data-sharing should be based on the principle of “single source
                of truth,” which means that data-sharing from various agencies
                should be consistent with data from the original source. For
                example, all data about individual identities must be similar to
                the data that are kept or shared at the JPN, especially
                regarding names, identity cards, addresses etc. JPN is the
                single source of truth if the agencies require confirmation
                about the data related to individual identity. The expert in the
                interview states that:<br />

                “Data quality is fundamentally independent of analytical
                abilities/skills. Quality data needs to be guaranteed from the
                beginning, which is the moment the data is created. Quality
                data, in my view, refers to correct, authentic and
                unquestionable data. In relation to that, the principle of
                “single source of truth” is important in government services
                where certain data can only be provided by certain agencies and

                For the data to be valuable or have business value, it needs to
                be shared. Through data-sharing, the data creates values that
                are beneficial for employees, businesses, and society. There are
                many ways organisations can use data to improve performance.
                First, through data-sharing, organisations can have data on
                their employees’ productivity, whether they need training and
                what kind of training. Employees can also monitor and forecast
                their own performance if organisations practice data-sharing
                related to HR practices. For organisations, data-sharing through
                predictive analytics and foresight could help them take
                precautionary steps and develop strategies to prepare for future
                challenges and be ready to face the problem when it comes.
                Data-sharing also helps decision-makers, policymakers, leaders,
                and managers to make accurate and informed decisions for
                problem-solving. Second, through data-sharing, the organisation
                can increase its business values, for example, by creating
                applications. Without data, applications may not be useful to
                the business. However, with data-sharing, many applications can
                be developed to benefit the business, create value, and help the
                people and society. Organisations can not only sell their
                products or services and reach more customers, but earn
                additional income by displaying advertisements and links and by
                charging fees from other vendors and individuals. Data-sharing
                also provides real-time data, which is required by many people,
                including businesses and society in general. This not only helps
                organisations but also boosts other businesses and generates
                more opportunities for data-sharing.<br />

                2)&nbsp; Identifying best practices for data management and
                analysis
              </h1>
              <div
                id="text_block-1444-164"

              >
                The expert recommended that data management should primarily
                follow the Government Wide Reference Architecture (GWRA) for
                effective data-sharing practices. The GWRA ensures that the
                standard of data usage in the delivery of government services is
                uniform. It can be used as a foundation for providing digital
                services to society. In-depth knowledge of GWRA Data is
                essential to determine the value of data in government service
                data-driven smart initiatives, data-sharing and data analytics.
                GWRA provides a framework for categorising of Government Data
                based on the service owner/service provider and the legislation
                that allows data to be stored by the government. It also ensures
                data security in inter-agency data-sharing such as government
                open data-sharing and MyGDX. Therefore, GWRA should lay out the
                data architecture or structure before data-sharing for effective
                data-sharing practices. <br /><br />The government’s MAMPU
                agency conducted extensive research on data management practices
                in various countries before developing an open data-sharing
                portal and MyGDX. These portals are widely regarded as best
                practices and are often used as a reference by other countries,
                particularly in the ASEAN region. The World Bank has also
                recognised their effectiveness. Despite this, MAMPU continues to
                seek out even better practices, as stated by the expert:<br />

                “From the technology point of view, we are trying again and
                again, we are still doing study after study, comparison after
                comparison based on the findings that we engaged with the
                various agencies to make a comparison between what others (other
                countries) refer to when it comes to data sharing and what MyGDX
                has. So, we make countermeasures from a technology point of
                view. From the process point of view, we need to receive a word
                from one (1) source of power (so that we have a clear direction,
                instead of having more than one (1) source of power). So, we
                make the policy, guidelines, and impose technology solutions in
                our digital governance”.<br />

              >
                Version 2.0 of the open data-sharing portal is more
                user-friendly, complete with a dashboard and data catalogue to
                help people make analytical interpretations and make informed
                decisions. Most countries such as Denmark, Singapore, South
                Korea, Australia, the US, and the UK are still using portals
                similar to Malaysia’s public sector open data’s old portal
                version 1.0. Thus, it can be an opportunity for ASEAN Member
                States to learn from Malaysia’s public sector data-sharing.<br /><br />Another
                best practice is change management. According to the experts,
                change management should be regarded as an important aspect, as
                without change management, employees and organisations or
                governmental agencies would not be aware of the latest data
                management practices. They would not be motivated to improve and
                update the knowledge and technologies in line with time. Change
                management increases employees’ willingness to learn and study
                new ways of doing things and helps in enhancing data management
                and analysis. Exploring and driving the public sector’s
                data-sharing to become the best practice also needs highly
                competent employees and strong adherence to the standard set,
                including ensuring data creation is bias-free. Thus, the best
                practice is to have a trusted central agency that monitors and
                improvises the data-sharing technology and services to ensure
                the smooth performance of data-sharing practices. Having MAMPU
                as the central agency that provides ICT services to the
                agencies, safeguarding their trust and confidentiality of the
                data shared, and acting to mediate data-sharing from various
                federal agencies inMalaysia can be considered as the best
                practice to follow.<br />

              >
                There are a lot of potential opportunities for data-driven
                innovation. For example, MAMPU has conducted a competition
                programme called CHiPTA or Challenge on Innovation and
                Problem-Solving through Technology Advancement. CHiPTA is a
                combination of an Open Data Hackathon and a Mobile App Hackathon
                aimed at developing talent community creativity in developing
                innovative solutions and creativity by using the latest
                technology-based application development. From this CHiPTA, a
                variety of innovations were created, and a lot of potential
                innovation can be derived if more data-sharing were available.
                The only thing that restricted the innovation was the
                insufficient data-sharing. Regarding CHiPTA, the expert states
                that:<br />
              </div>
              <div
                id="text_block-1454-164"
                class="ct-text-block text-justify mrgn-bttm-2 text-quote"
              >
                “Yes, I see it is indeed towards that (i.e. data-driven
                innovation). Based on CHiPTA, I see a lot of innovation created.
                I mean, there are many innovative solutions. I see that this
                time, a lot of innovations in terms of solutions to the real
                case of the problem. Many applications were created in terms of
                innovative solutions to the problem that is actually happening
                in solving real case problems. Only, it has limited solutions
                because of the data (unavailable data). For example, there a
                “Rahmah application” created to find stores or restaurants
                selling Rahmah menus. So, what data do we want? Store location
                data. However, the data about the location of Rahmah stores are
                not openly available”. In creating this app, one (1) of the
                participants has to go to each store, tag and text himself and
                then key in those data in the system. If he has the data (if the
                data is openly available, or even if they are not openly
                available, people still can subscribe to those data), from the
                point of view of solution development, maybe he can go further,
                there are many more issues he can cover, thus will open
                opportunities, space and compulsion to share data”.<br />
              </div>
              <div
                id="text_block-1456-164"

              >
                According to the expert, many organisations possess data, but do
                not share it openly. Public sector agencies, for instance, have
                access to a variety of data but are usually kept private. This
                leads to a lack of innovation. Data-sharing is essential for
                fostering innovation, as it encourages people to think about
                possible ways to improve the situation. In the context of the
                Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), which includes technologies
                such as robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
                big data analytics, data is crucial.<br /><br />The expert also
                suggests that sharing data can accelerate innovation,
                particularly when it comes to confidential data that was
                previously restricted. MyGDX allows for more data-sharing, which
                in turn can drive data-based innovation, resulting in the
                creation of new business operations and applications. However,
                for data-driven innovation to thrive, it needs to be backed by
                leaders and legislation. Currently, many individuals and
                organisations are unwilling to share their data without legal
                protection. MAMPU has developed two (2) data portals that employ
                technologies to safeguard data security and improve data-sharing
                practices. MAMPU is also addressing the confidentiality issue,
                which has led to people refusing to share data, by developing
                the MyGDX portal. The MyGDX portal requires data classification
                from agencies and uses technologies such as API and SFTP to
                maintain data confidentiality, thus increasing data security and
                confidence among people and organisations to share their data.
                Opportunities for data-driven innovation are significant when
                people start sharing data. Data-sharing can drive innovation in
                various areas like agriculture, education, and business
                operations, aligned with the 4IR.<br />

                  Frequent promotions are needed to highlight the importance and
                  benefits of data-sharing to both the public and organisations.
                  These promotions should emphasise the crucial role data plays
                  in creating business value in terms of performance,
                  efficiency, and effectiveness. Additionally, they should

                  It is important to address the resistance of data owners, such
                  as agencies, people, and organisations, to share their data.
                  This resistance may stem from fear of the unknown, lack of
                  trust, and lack of control over the use of their data. To
                  overcome these issues, there needs to be more promotion and
                  awareness through social media, television, etc. The
                  government must also take swift and serious action when data
                  breaches occur to build trust with data owners. Data owners
                  need to be informed about what data users are doing with their
                  data and given the freedom to control and withdraw their
                  consent whenever they see fit.<br />

                  Promoting data-sharing should always come with a clear
                  explanation of how shared data is protected against misuse.
                  This includes the processes and technologies used to ensure
                  data security and prevent data leakage and other suspicious
                  activities such as hacking and stealing. To prevent data
                  misuse for the benefit of others without giving anything in
                  return to data owners, there should be insurance covering the
                  security of data-sharing. Insuring data-sharing not only
                  increases trust among data owners but also increases the
                  tendency to voluntarily share data while being entitled to
                  receive benefits if their consent is misused.

                  Another mechanism to improve security is to introduce terms
                  such as “secure sharing by informed concept” embedded in the
                  data-sharing practice. Several cybersecurity fundamentals and
                  technologies, such as data encryption algorithms and data
                  authenticity services like digital signatures can be adopted
                  here. The usage of digital certificates among data owners and
                  governments would also provide secure data-sharing and proof
                  against loss of data confidentiality, integrity, and
                  authenticity.

                  Another cutting-edge service is adopting blockchain
                  technology, which can clearly identify conditions and
                  constraints before sharing data. This empowers data owners to
                  have more control over their shared data. The use of
                  blockchain technology enforces data integrity and offers
                  tamper-resistant services.

                  The government should prioritise educating and promoting
                  awareness about data-sharing at an early stage, including in
                  secondary schools, to different levels of society. It is
                  essential to impart knowledge about data-sharing to reduce
                  resistance to data-sharing practices and encourage acceptance
                  of data-sharing.

                The amount of data produced on a daily basis is immense.
                However, data-sharing is not common practice, especially in the
                private sector where companies are cautious and less interested
                in open data-sharing. Despite realising the benefits of
                data-sharing, organisations tend to restrict access to their
                data. This approach limits the potential of the collected data
                to be fully utilised. In today’s digital economy, where big data
                is prevalent, organisations should embrace data-sharing. Studies
                have shown that data-sharing improves decision-making and is
                fundamental to staying relevant in the highly competitive
                business world. It is important to note that only high-quality
                data would produce the desired effect. Quality data is crucial
                and increases the effectiveness of data-sharing, analytical
                capabilities, human resources skills, and the sophistication and
                automation of other tools.<br />
